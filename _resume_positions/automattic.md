- I worked with Automattic to build the PHP library for Simperium.com.
- I also worked with Automattic to build a command-line test suite that could send multiple parallel tests to their Simperium.com API and return results.
- A separate test suite also performed similar actions on the Simperium.com auth API to test adding, updating and removing users from the API as multiple parallel tests to simulate an app with multiple users signing up and trying out things.
- Applicable Skills: PHP  CLI  Technical Writing
