- While under contract with Columbus Networks, I maintained their existing websites and servers, and also designed and built new websites for them.
- Built a job search template system where they could use a backend to create new pre-built websites from scratch and then simply edit a few template files to change how it looks completely
- Designed, and developed schooljobsnow.com which was a job search site that was built in conjunction with scholastic (the book fair guys).
- Other projects involved building their emails4educators.com website and a custom domain parking system. Emails4educators allowed them to offer webmail services to teachers around the world, and the domain parking system let them template domains that were parked to be used as landing pages for the webmail system.
- Also maintained their corporate websites and introduced new technologies to them, as well as upgrading all of their websites to PHP5 instead of being early PHP4.
- Also managed other contractors and instructed them on where code could be uploaded and which parts of the sites did what.
- As webmaster, I was responsible for keeping the servers up to date and running well. This also included keeping software updated, and performing daily backups of the websites and database which each week, were downloaded to Amazon S3 for holding.
