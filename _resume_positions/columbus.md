- I used Perl, PHP, JavaScript, Flash and SQL to create various software products and services for use by both clients and internally.
- Some of these projects included developing a PHP based site for Waterway House Boats which included a backend manager that allowed users to use a FrontPage-like editor to create pages that were viewed by users, the manager also featured a photo album to allow stock photos to be uploaded and used in these pages. A system was also implemented so that all reservations and forms were saved into the database and the manager could log into to the backend manager and view the saved messages.
- The manager could also send newsletters to users.
- I also developed the educationjobfairs.com site, which is a site that allows exhibitors to host booths in job fairs and job seekers to visit and learn about the exhibitors. This site included a Flash-based chat system, a message board for each booth, and an exhibitorâ€™s lounge, which was where exhibitors could edit their booths through a booth wizard system, chat with jobseekers during scheduled chat sessions, and view and reply to messages left in their message board. An admin section was also created which allowed employees of Columbus to set up job fairs and add exhibitors to each job fair. This system also allowed users to set reminders to receive an e-mail before a chat session started, and also sent a reminder to all chat moderators 2 hours before their scheduled chat sessions
