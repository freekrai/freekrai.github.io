- I worked with Twilio to build an MMS Whiteboard app to display on a giant 55 inch touchscreen monitor at the AWS reInvent 2014 conference in Las Vegas.
- The MMS Whiteboard app let you draw on an HTML canvas on a web page, then enter a phone number to send the drawn artwork off to a cell phone.
- Part of this project also involved traveling to the AWS reInvent conference in Las Vegas and attending the Twilio booth to provide technical expertise and sign copies of my books.
- Applicable Skills: PHP  Technical Writing  Customer Support
