**Writing for rogerstringer.com is my job.** I wouldnâ€™t be able to do it without the direct support from readers like you.

A membership subscription is $4 a month, and the perks include:

- Access to The Members-Only section: where you can download code, plugins, and ebooks not available elsewhere, as well as articles and tips only available to members.
- Access to me for development, server or startup questions for 15 minutes each month.
- Supporting the full-time writing and growth of rogerstringer.com.

If the value and enjoyment you get from rogerstringer.com is worth $4 a month then I would love to have your support as a subscribing member
