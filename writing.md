## My Own Writing Projects

For my own writing, I write here on this blog, as well as on [The Flybase Blog](http://blog.flybase.io), and I am also 
currently focusing on writing two self-published books. 

Previously, I've [published with Pakt press](http://twiliocookbook.com/), but this time, I've chosen to go the self-publishing route via [Lean Pub](https://leanpub.com/u/freekrai).

#### Why self-publish?

I like to have more control over how the book looks, how it reads, and what it brings to readers.

Having a publisher worked great, but there were so many things that were out of my control, from the layout, to the look of the book cover, to even most of the wording and updates. You are even at the mercy of what tools you can use. For example with Pakt, all your writing had to be done in Microsoft Word.

Lean Pub is a service I've followed since it first launched 7 years ago as a WordPress MU powered site, you can write using Markdown files, you have control over how things look, and how they read.

I'm excited about taking my writing in this direction and can't wait to show you what I have planned.

#### What books are in the works?

The first book in the works is called the [The Little Real-time Web Development Book](https://leanpub.com/real-time-web).

This book will be a relatively short book, hence the name, but it will be useful in learning best-practices in building web apps that use real-time APIs such as Flybase.

The second planned book is a handy guide to building call centers with Twilio and Flybase using Node.js. I'll talk more about this book as I actually get everything planned out.
