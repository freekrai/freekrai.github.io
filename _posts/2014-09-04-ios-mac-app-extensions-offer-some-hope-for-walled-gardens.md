The genius of these extensions is the way they’re bundled with the apps.

If you have the app installed, you’ll see its extension in other apps automatically. And if you don’t, then you won’t.

And if you want to get rid of an app, you don’t have to do anything extra to remove its extensions — they get removed when the app gets removed.
