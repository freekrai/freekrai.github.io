Matt Gemmell:

> Will there be new laptops, tablets, phones, wearables, and even exotic new categories of machines in the future? Of course. Will I buy them? Some, at least – unquestionably. New is novel, and nothing lasts forever. I have no idea what’s to come. I do know that I’ll no longer need a new laptop.

Matt hits another one out of the park. Wonderful as always.
