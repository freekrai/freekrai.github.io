> Alongside the new Galaxy Note 4 phablet, Samsung is today announcing a new accessory, the Gear VR. The Gear VR is a virtual reality headset powered by the Note 4. Samsung built it in partnership with Oculus, maker of the Oculus Rift, arguably the best VR headset, and recent Facebook acquistion. The company says the Gear VR will be available later this fall for an unspecified price.
> 
> The Gear VR brings to mind Google’s Cardboard project, which uses a smartphone and cheap lenses to provide a basic 3D virtual reality experience. But it’s a much more complete product than Cardboard, much closer to the Oculus Rift in design and apparance (and you don’t have to build it yourself).
