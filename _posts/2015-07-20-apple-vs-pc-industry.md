John Gruber, in reply to [Robert McMillan's WJS Digits](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/09/pc-sales-continue-to-fall/) blog post.

> To put Apple’s current industry position in perspective, the company probably sold somewhere between 60-65 million iOS devices last quarter. (I’m guessing ~50 million iPhones, ~10-12 million iPads, and a handful of million iPod Touches.) The average selling price of a PC [has fallen to under $400](http://www.statista.com/statistics/203759/average-selling-price-of-desktop-pcs-worldwide/). The average selling price of an iPhone [has been estimated to be as high as $660](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/07/16/ubs-forecasts-iphone-asp-at-660-pushing-apples-june-margins-to-409).

> So while iOS devices, taken as a whole, might still fall a few million units short of the PC industry, they’re clearly generating more in revenue. More importantly, the PC industry operates on razor-thin margins; iOS devices sell with remarkably high margins.

> And, if that’s not enough, the “PC industry” includes the Mac, which appears to continue to be holding its own in the face of this overall slide in demand — IDC is forecasting a 16 percent increase in Mac sales globally for the quarter.
