Just 37 days after launching, Mailbox has just been acquired by Dropbox.

I use Mailbox with one of my email accounts, and I like it. And Iâ€™m also happy to see that Dropbox is the company to acquire Mailbox.

I have a lot of trust and goodwill towards Dropbox, and, I am very interested to see how Dropbox plans to use the code, ideas, and talent of the Mailbox team.
