Dan Levine, reporting for Reuters:

> Google is lobbying officials in at least three U.S. states to stop proposed restrictions on driving with headsets such as Google Glass, marking some of the first clashes over the nascent wearable technology.
> 
> Some eight U.S. states are considering regulation of Google Glass, a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame. Law enforcement and other groups are concerned that drivers wearing the devices will pay more attention to their email than the road, causing serious accidents. [â€¦]
> 
> Google Inc has deployed lobbyists to persuade elected officials in Illinois, Delaware and Missouri that it is not necessary to restrict use of Google Glass behind the wheel, according to state lobbying disclosure records and interviews conducted by Reuters.

This seems like one of the dumbest moves you could make.. Who could possibly argue that texting while driving is safe?

No reasonable person who has used Google Glass could conclude that interacting with Glass while driving is substantially different from texting while driving.
