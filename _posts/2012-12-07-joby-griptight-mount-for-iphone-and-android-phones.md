> Designed with a durable steel inner frame and rubber grip pads, the Mount holds your phone in place, even when rotated sideways or upside down. So get a grip on your smartphone camera, capture a short film on your iPhone, or shoot a street scene with your Android or Windows smartphone—it’s easy with your handy tripod and the GripTight Mount!

**How does it compare to other similiar devices out there such as the glif?**

Well, the fact that it doesn’t matter if your phone is in a case or not, factors pretty strongly into this. There’s also the fact that it doesn’t matter what type of phone you use it with, so you are open to new possibilities.

The glif works well, but if you use a case, then you have to pop it out of the case, and also if you switch devices, then you are hooped.

The GripTight Mount fits nicely in your pocket and can clip onto any tripod, and attaches to any smartphone, so you get a nice stable experience regardless of device or case the device is in.
