> Launch Center Pro was released in the App Store last week. It has a smart interface that focuses on launching actions rather than apps.
> 
> By using URL schemes that are built into third-party apps, it quickly launches actions like searching on Yelp or posting a tweet in Tweetbot and has a text input area so you can pass text into these other apps. It really feels like Alfred but on the iPhone.
