> Imagine yourself making a presentation with nothing but your iPad in hand. You’re not chained to the podium or sitting behind a desk. You are roaming like a lion, and you are awesome. For the cost of an Apple TV and an AirPort Express (just 200 bucks), you too can get some lion-like tendencies.

I’ve been a fan of using airPlay to present wireless for a while now, and it works pretty well.
