Craig Hockenberry on Apple’s newfound public confidence:

> We witnessed something amazing yesterday: a WWDC keynote that will be remembered for a long time. And not for the reason you might expect.
> 
>  As developers, it’s easy to focus on the fantastic software that was announced: a UI refresh that’s getting a thumbs up from designers and developers alike, great new user-facing features in iOS and OS X, and literally thousands of new APIs that let developers do new and amazing things with their apps. We even got a new programming language!
> 
> ***BLINK***
> 
>  But that all pales in comparison to the undercurrent for all these changes: Apple has a newfound confidence in itself. It’s at the top of its game, and it knows it.
> 
>  The is personified by the man who ran the show: Craig Federighi. It was only four years ago that we first saw him [on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQHAIsGPQE&feature=kp) at an Apple event. His shaking hand is still painful to watch, especially if you’ve felt that same fear while giving a presentation on stage. Yesterday, we saw a different man, one that owned the stage and the products being presented.
> 
>  With this confidence, we’re starting to see some important cultural change in the company.
