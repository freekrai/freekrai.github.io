Microsoft really wants to make sure iOS and Mac developers are keeping Internet Explorer 10 in mind when working on their projects.

To help boost that effort, the company is offering developers a better deal than you’ll  ever likely to see: a QuickStart kit that includes “free” (after $25 donation to one of three charities) copies of Windows 8 Pro and Parallels Desktop 8. Both pieces of software will be shipped on a USB stick at the end of April.

IE program manager Sandeep Singhal explained that developers frequently use virtualization to test browser compatibility across operating systems. He’s also quick to admit that this strategy can prove costly for an individual or company working on their first app. “Costs to purchase software and licensing can be difficult if you’re that startup looking for your first big breakthrough,” Singhal writes.

Microsoft notes that only a “limited supply” of QuickStart USB sticks are available, and considering the major savings on offer here, I don’t expect to see them last very long.
