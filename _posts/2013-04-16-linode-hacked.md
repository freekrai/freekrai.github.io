Linode’s blog:

> As a result of the vulnerability, this group gained access to a web server, parts of our source code, and ultimately, our database. … Our investigation reveals that this group did not have access to any other component of the Linode infrastructure, including access to the host machines or any other server or service that runs our infrastructure.

I moved away from Linode a long time ago, but for any existing Linode customers,  it’s also worth reading [the abridged IRC log from one of the hackers](http://turtle.dereferenced.org/~nenolod/linode/linode-abridged.txt) bragging about the attack to get an idea of what was taken and how. It may influence your decision whether to remain a Linode customer.

Personally, I’m glad I left a couple years ago.
