> By soft releasing the iPad Mini Retina, Apple achieved three crucial things.
> 
> - Apple’s biggest fans got theirs first. Who knew about this first? The people who follow the Apple blogs and digerati. Judging by Twitter, this worked perfectly.
> - The grey market queueing for the iPad Mini Retina was going to be immense. By going online the incredibly poor optics (the front of Apple lines, which attracts a lot of media, was full of people who were not fans but paid to be there) are mitigated.
> - The last thing Apple wants is hundreds of customers turning up everyday to be dissappointed in a store which is meant to be a happy place — Apple does not want their stores to be associated with disappointment and frustration!

Nailed it! Having the new retina iPad Mini so severely supply-constrained sucks, but given that it is constrained, the best way to put it on sale is quietly.

Apple is going to sell them as fast as they can make them for the foreseeable future, no use having people line up for disappointment.
