> There seem to be only _three_ kinds of apps that make sense given the current hardware and software on the Apple Watch.

Today’s Apple Watch and watchOS are very limited and most apps are necessarily _not good_, but that doesn’t mean there’s no place for any apps. 

David’s ideas of what makes sense as a Watch app (and what does not) are pretty accurate from what I've seen so far, and David has more experience building Watch apps than anyone.
