Guardians of the Galaxy… a team of screw ups that manage to actually make interesting reading… and also look like they should manage to make a pretty good movie, a little different than the usual superhero movie that we usually get..

This looks like it should be pretty interesting, and you can’t really argue about the use of Blue Suede’s Hooked on a feeling being included…
