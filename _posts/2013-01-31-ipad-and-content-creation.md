> In doing research this week, I came across an article by Richard Gaywood that I found to be one of the most balanced takes on the three year-old [iPad is for consumption/creation](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/04/ipad-consumption) subject.

It’s fine to acknowledge the shortcomings of an iPad for content creation, whilst keeping in mind that these are only shortcomings — not hard limits. What’s important is understanding your needs and the ways different devices can fulfil or frustrate them. What’s important is the nuance; the shades of grey between the “the iPad is a toy” and “the iPad is the future of computing” extremes.

Try making a calendar entry from details sent in an email, for example — if the automatic tap-to-make-entry fails you, lots of tedious back-and-forthing between two apps becomes necessary. Try collating data from a dozen disconnected cells in a spreadsheet into a wordprocessor document. Try cross-checking two spreadsheets against each other. Try following a tutorial in a web page about how to carry out a task in your presentation software. Try plagiarising a Wikipedia page by subtly rewording it into a high school paper. And so on, and so forth.

> Saying that the iPad can be used for “content creation” isn’t a crusade against people who don’t like Apple, iOS, or the iPad. Similarly, blindly insisting that the iPad is for “consumption only” is just silly and shortsighted. More importantly, the term [content](http://shawnblanc.net/2011/08/consuming-content/) is awful. So, for the sake of this linked post, I’m going to refer to the issue as: doing real work and/or tasks that you’d normally do on a computer.

This debate is one that never goes away. I use my iPad all the time for content creation, and yet, I know many who just use theirs to read or surf the Internet from their couch.
