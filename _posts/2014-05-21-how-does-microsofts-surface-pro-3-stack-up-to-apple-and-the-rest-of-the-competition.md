![How does Microsoft`s Surface Pro 3 stack up to Apple and the rest of the competition?](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140520-221328-80008934.jpg "How does Microsoft`s Surface Pro 3 stack up to Apple and the rest of the competition?")

> Microsoft [unveiled the Surface Pro 3](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/20/5734866/surface-pro-3-hands-on-photos-impressions) today, and now more than ever before, the company is pushing the message that this is a product capable of replacing your trusted and proven laptop. In his usual style, Surface chief Panos Panay boldly proclaimed that the Surface Pro 3 will remove the conflict of choosing between a tablet and laptop — that it’s been designed without compromise with the best aspects of both.

Aside from Apple’s MacBook Air, which Panay mentioned repeatedly on stage, Microsoft is finally facing improved (and genuinely impressive) competition from Windows machine manufacturers like Lenovo too. The Surface Pro 3 has clearly been designed to be more productive than an iPad Air, but can it really unseat leading laptops like Apple’s MacBook Air and Lenovo’s Yoga 2 Pro?
