> Meanwhile, I was reminded via Timehop yesterday how much I hated the Android Honeycomb emulator two years ago, which got me wondering where Android version (specifically that two-year-old Honeycomb) adoption sits. Turns out, according to Google’s own numbers, that Gingerbread, the version prior to Honeycomb is the undisputed leader of the market with a 47.4 percent share.

Nothing new here, but an inconvenient truth for the “Android is winning” crowd.
