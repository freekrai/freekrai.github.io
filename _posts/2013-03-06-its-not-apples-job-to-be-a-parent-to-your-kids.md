Jim Dalrymple:

> I can understand how some parents would be upset if Apple didn’t have some kind of controls to limit the use of the iPhone and iPad, but the fact is they do.

> The simple fact is, as parents, it’s up to us to monitor what our kids do with technology or any toy. If you choose not to use the included controls because they are a hassle, then that’s your choice. You made that decision.

> Apple’s built-in controls allow the parent to disable Web surfing, the ability to watch movies or TV shows, deny the ability for purchases including in-app purchases, you can even disable a child’s ability to install or delete apps.

I have to agree with Jim on this. My 4 year old has an iPad, she currently has an iPad 3, but she’s owned an iPad since she was 2. We used to use the restrictions so that she couldn’t use youtube, or purchase apps.

Now, she’s learned not to surf random things on youtube (with her, it’s mostly Monster High or Maru the Box Cat videos), and she’s also learned that she can look on the app store, but she can’t buy any apps.

If you don’t use the restrictions, and your child goes crazy, then, yes, a kid mode makes sense. But really.. you already have a kid mode.. Just enable restrictions and restrict what your child can do with their iDevice.
