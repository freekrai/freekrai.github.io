[**Moobile**](http://www.moobilejs.com/) is an exciting and fresh project; a **mobile web application framework built on MooTools**.

Currently, it is focused on providing a **iOS-like experience on WebKit browsers** and comes with many controls like bar, button, image, list, activity indicator, slider and more.

It also has **support for transitions** like fade, slide, cubic or cover and can display native-like alerts.

Interfaces created with **Moobile** are fluid, they will work well both in iPhone + iPad and look good when orientation changes.

The download package **includes a boilerplate** for quickly starting projects, related **PSD files** and a **simulator.**
