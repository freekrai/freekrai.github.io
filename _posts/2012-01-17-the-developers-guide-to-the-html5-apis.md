Handy reference..

> As I’m sure you’re aware that there are two versions of the HTML5 specification, one published by the W3C and another by the WHATWG. The living HTML specification maintained by the WHATWG contains additional APIs to those in the W3C HTML5 spec (although generally they are also maintained by the W3C but in separate specifications). Alongside those in the specification are a number of related APIs that form part of the standards stack and are often grouped under the “HTML5” umbrella term. In some cases the APIs have been around and implemented for a while, but they’ve never been documented; something which HTML5 has set out to change. In this article we’re not going to look at code but instead we’ll focus on describing the APIs, their purpose and progress. We’ll then point you in the right direction to find out more.
