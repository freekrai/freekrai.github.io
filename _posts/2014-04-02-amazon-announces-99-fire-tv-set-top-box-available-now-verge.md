> Apple and Roku have a new competitor in the living room. Amazon just announced its own video streaming device: the $99 Amazon Fire TV. It starts shipping today. “We need to invent and simplify on behalf of customers,” said Amazon’s Peter Larsen. During the presentation, Larsen went over three pain points of current devices: search, performance, and “closed ecosystem.” Fire TV promises to avoid the problems that plague other living room hardware, according to Larsen.
> 
> In terms of performance, FireTV features a quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, which Larsen said should eliminate any hint of lag. Amazon claims it’s three times faster than the latest set-top boxes from Roku and Apple. Amazon is also looking to avoid complaints of a closed ecosystem by bringing in numerous partners.
> 
> “It’s got a ton of content,” said Larsen.

A little competition for Apple TV and Roku..
