David Karp, CEO of Tumblr, recently had a chat with Om Malik, and had this to say about the iPad Mini:

> I am over laptops and the posture that comes with them. I am coding a lot less, so I use my computers a lot less. I still want to simplify even further and carry just one device. So, I want to try the iPad Mini with cellular antenna as my only device and as a phone replacement, and use Skype and/or Google Voice instead.
