Matt’s review reflects something I’ve felt since getting an iPhone 5, and which other reviews haven’t hit on yet: the idea that an iOS device’s preeminent feature is its display:

> Apple has been making small but important decisions here and there since the original iPhone to ensure that as little as possible comes between you and whatever you happen to be interacting with on the screen.

I completely agree 100%, and Matt also topped that with the fact that the weight and feel of the phone is of critical importance with making the device “disappear” in your hand.

The iPhone 5 is the lightest iPhone so far while also sporting the largest and highest-quality screen to date.
