[Steve](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/22081/apple-now-rejecting-apps-with-pebble-smartwatch-support) ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9426542) ):

> We have just had the latest version of our SeaNav US iOS app rejected by Apple because we support the Pebble Smartwatch and say so in the app description and meta-data (we also state in the review notes that "This application was approved for use with the Pebble MFI Accessory in the Product Plan xxxxxx-yyyy (Pebble Smartwatch)".

> The problem appears to be that Apple has reclassified smart watches as a "mobile platform" whereas they did not before. So suddenly having an app so much as mention a smart watch brand is tantamount to mentioning, say, Android.

> According to other posts in the linked discussion, other apps are being rejected under the same rationale and for the same reasons, and attempts to appeal those rejections aren’t going through (Apple’s reviewers are continuing to reject new versions of these apps until they remove any/all mention of "Pebble" in their metadata).

Apparently, this is now Apple policy and not a reviewer's mistake. This is not a good policy for iPhone users, since almost any accessory could potentially be considered a `mobile platform`.

What will happen next? Rejecting apps belonging to Fitbit (or Jawbone UP or Misfit Shine's)? 

I can't see anyway that this policy helps anyone, even Apple. 


Being an avid Pebble user, supporting the Pebble doesn’t diminish Apple Watch; the two watches are not even in direct competition. 

Rather, it increases the value of the iPhone platform to have all these devices working with iOS. 

Past App Store rejections have made Apple look petty, or perhaps evil. This one just makes it look stupid.
