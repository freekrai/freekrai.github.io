> Until Paper for iPad launched, we didn’t know many people who were clamoring for a stylus to use in conjunction with their iPad. And now, the Best Buy around the block from us is sold out of styli, and Amazon’s in-house stylus has reached #1 on the sales chart for tablet accessories — ahead of smart covers, screen protectors, cases, and stands. Well OK, maybe it was Draw Something that spurred the rush, but if it’s not completely evident, the stylus is making a bit of a comeback.

I actually own a couple of these. The [Alupen Pro](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/06/17/just-mobile-alupen-pro-stylus), [Cosmonaut](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/04/01/cosmonaut), the Adonit Jot Pro, and also the Wacom Bamboo Stylus so it’s nice to see them all reviewed here.
