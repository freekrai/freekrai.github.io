This tasty recipe was posted on here before, and got accidentally deleted when I did the jekyll migration last year. Since then, I've had people asking for the recipe again, so I am putting it back here now. :)

Avocados are great as they are flexible and can fit into any type of dishs. This dip takes avocados in a new way, and uses the other ingredients to give you a rich balanced dip.

### What you need:

- 2 teaspoons hot sauce _(pick your favourite hot sauce there is no wrong choice here)_
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 ripe avocados
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 clove garlic
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil

### How to make it:

1. Cut all around the ripe avocados down to the pit. Twist and separate the halved fruit. Remove the pit with a spoon, then scoop the flesh with a spoon into your food processor bowl.
2. Add the zest and juice of 1 lemon to the food processor.
3. Chop garlic on your board and mash with 1 teaspoon salt to paste the garlic. Add garlic paste and the red wine vinegar to the food processor.
4. Place lid on the food processor and turn it on.
5. While the blade is spinning, stream in extra-virgin olive oil and add hot sauce.
6. Stop processor, taste dressing and adjust seasonings
