> Google apparently has taken one step back from its “origin chip” plan that would hide the full addresses for Web sites that people visit with its Chrome browser.

> On Tuesday, Chrome team member [Peter Kasting demoted one aspect of the address-hiding feature](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=331373#c14) from a top priority to a third-level priority. “The origin chip work is backburnered,” he said in his explanation on Google’s issue-tracking site.

The new Safari on OS X Yosemite does pretty much the same thing. I wonder if Apple is going to stick with it, or back pedal as well now.

I have some mixed feelings about hiding the full web address, while I do think it’s probably better for most users to just show the domain name, I’d also like an option to restore the old behavior.
