![Rogers thanks shomi customers as streaming service shuts doors on November 30th](http://rogerstringer.com/media/shomi.jpg)

> Rogers today thanked its customers who subscribed to shomi for trying out a Canadian innovation.
> 
> "We tried something new, and customers who used shomi loved it. It's like a great cult favourite with a fantastic core audience that unfortunately just isn't big enough to be renewed for another season," said Melani Griffith, Senior Vice President, Content, Rogers. "We will be reaching out to eligible customers in the coming days as we have a wide range of premium experiences available for people to enjoy."

> shomi, a joint venture of Rogers and Shaw Communications announced today an orderly wind down with service ending November 30, 2016. As a result, Rogers expects to incur a loss on investment of approximately $100-140 million in its third quarter ending September 30, 2016 relating to the carrying value of its investment and a provision related to future liabilities in shomi.

I've actually been a shomi subscriber for over a year. Admittedly I was a subscriber mostly because it was included as a free two-year add on with my Rogers cell phone, but I enjoyed the service.

Shomi is actually a little closer to Hulu than Netflix, as it focuses more than TV shows than movies. It even had contracts to provide new episodes just after they aired on TV for shows like Empire, Fresh off the boat, Modern Family, etc.

Personally, I think one of the bigger issues was the slow rollout of Shomi. For the first year after launch, it was only available to people who were already cable customers of Rogers and Shaw, and then opened its doors to other users. But by then, it was already too late.
