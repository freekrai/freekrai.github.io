Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch:

> But even a stretch of presentations that had [one attendee asleep](https://twitter.com/mat/status/481866721578328065) in his chair apparently wasn’t enough runway to allow a mention of two troubled Google children: Glass and Plus.
> 
>  Google+, the company’s attempt to unify its various products with a webbing of identity and social, was barely, barely mentioned at all during the keynote. Last year it took up a major chunk of the presentation and the year before it felt like a Google+ plus Glass keynote (complete with skydivers and biking on the roof of Moscone) with a smattering of other stuff thrown in.
> 
>  This year, Glass wasn’t even mentioned, and no presenters wore it on stage. Even when the discussion turned to wearables — an ideal time to work in its face computer — Google had nothing to say.

Everyone is expecting Plus to go away this year… Could the same be true for Glass?
