Marco:

> This has not been a popular decision, to put it lightly, but most Prime customers — which I’ve been since 2005 — aren’t really going anywhere. There’s nowhere to go. Amazon has either destroyed or bought every competitor that has ever come close to its retail business.

I’m a Prime customer, but only for the past year as Amazon only started offering it to Canadian customers last year, and though the $20 price hike is a bummer, of course, Prime is still a worthwhile investment for us. It’s so easy to just order a one-off item off Amazon to avoid having to go pick it up at a store, I’ve even known a few people who have gone so far as to order their lawnmowers using Amazon Prime rather than having to pick it up in a store.
