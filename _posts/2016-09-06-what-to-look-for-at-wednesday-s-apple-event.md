Jason Snell: 

> Apple’s big fall media event is Wednesday, and I’ll be there bright and early to cover the whole thing here on Six Colors. Thanks to the leaks from Apple and its supply chain, most of us think we’ve got a pretty good idea of what will be announced—though surprises are welcome!
> 
> The devil’s in the details, though. This event is Apple’s big chance to put all of its fall product offerings in context, to tell stories that explain why these products do what they do (or in some cases, don’t do what they don’t). This is product marketing at its highest level, and the way Apple introduces a product can be enlightening.

> So here are a few details I’ll be keeping my eyes out for tomorrow
