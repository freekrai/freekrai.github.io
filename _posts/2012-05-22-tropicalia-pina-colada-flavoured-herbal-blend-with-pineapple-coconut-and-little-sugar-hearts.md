This is the first tea I’ve reviewed, so why am I reviewing tea?

Mostly because I drink a lot of tea, I have a fine collection of teas that I enjoy drinking, and this is a new one from Davds Tea that my whole family enjoys.

> Apple, pineapple cubes, coconut, rose petals, safflower blossoms, sugar hearts, marigold petals

Those ingredients make for a nice iced tea experience, sweet but not too sweet. We keep a big pitcher of it in the fridge and just refill as we go.

I definitely recommend trying this tea out some time if you want a nice iced tea experience.
