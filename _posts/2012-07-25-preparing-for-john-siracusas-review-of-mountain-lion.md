> You wouldn’t run a marathon without walking a few miles the day before. You wouldn’t join a spelling bee without picking up a dictionary. You wouldn’t throw an all-night LAN party without downing several dozen energy drinks.

> Then, why are you even thinking about reading John Siracusa’s epic 24-page review of Mountain Lion without getting prepped and ready for it?

Basically, a bunch of geeks decided to get ready for the epically long read of John Siracusa’s Mountain Lion review..
