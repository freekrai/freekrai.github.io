Shawn Blanc:

> These two new iPads are marvels.
> 
> It’s already amazing that there exists gadgets made of aluminum and glass which weigh less than a pound and have screens that rival the resolution of a printed magazine. Now add to that the fact these devices have touch screens so true-to-life and so responsive that it feels as if you’re literally manipulating the pixels with your fingers.
> 
> And it doesn’t end there.
> 
> Pacing around the coffee table in my office, thinking about the new iPads while contemplating the big picture of things like personal computers that fit in our pockets and purses, it’s easy to get swept away in just what an incredible day and age we live in.
> 
> These devices are also connected to the world wide web — allowing me to communicate with friends, family, members, and strangers alike. A photo I took of my son using my phone has magically appeared on my iPad, and I can email it to my parents with ease; I can write words and publish them to a place where anyone in the world can come to read; I can download music and books; and so, so much more.
> 
> But then, returning to Earth, what are the brass tacks here? I’ve been sending emails for over half my life; I’ve never owned a cell phone that couldn’t send a text message; I’ve been making my living publishing to the web for nearly three years; and this isn’t my first iPad.
> 
> But yet, in a way, this *is* my first iPad.
> 
> The iPad Air is, hands down, the most amazing iPad I’ve ever owned. And I’ve owned several.

Shawn is capturing what many have been feeling about the iPad Air, the new form factor, the speed, it all makes it work so much nicer, and that makes it so much nicer to *work with*.
