Post-it notes are a great tool for recreating the pixelated video game characters of yore, but this video from Zach King goes a step further by actually bringing those characters to life. The stop-motion clip features 7,000 Post-its and while it’s mainly focused on Super Mario, there are a few guest appearances as well, both from Pac-Man and the blocks from Tetris.
