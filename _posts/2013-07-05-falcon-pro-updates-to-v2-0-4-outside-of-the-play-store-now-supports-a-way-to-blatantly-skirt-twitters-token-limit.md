Falcon Pro is taking a clever approach in having users set up their own Twitter apps and then entering their API keys into the settings.. Allowing them to bypass the token limit imposed by Twitter…

This has been common for a few web apps for a while now, so I guess we’ll see how long Twitter will stand for this before making some sort of announcement.

It would probably be easier if Twitter just granted Falcon Pro more tokens.
