> Tools can make our workflows feel seamless, allowing us to focus on what we are building, and not worry about the process. Most web developers, on all portions of the stack, work from the command-line. There are countless utilities, which can make you more productive. These aren’t full blown command-line applications, such as Git, but rather simple and composable tools, which can improve your workflow as a web developer.
> 
> If you are on Mac OS X, you can use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install any of the tools that are not part of the standard packages. Each of these tools have pages worth of options, and only a fraction of them are reviewed below. If you’d like to learn more about each tool, begin in the `man` pages with `man <command>` or`<command> -h`.

Some interesting command-line tools.. I use most of them all the time, *Localtunnel* especially looks neat..
