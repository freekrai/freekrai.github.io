Marko Heijnen:

> Starting with just a simple line of code 11 years ago, WordPress has evolved to become the platform of more than 74 million websites.
> 
> Even with a vast array of competitors offering similar functionality, WordPress still dominates the CMS market with a [21.9% market share](http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y).
> 
> I have had a more detailed look at WordPress than most.
> 
> I have contributed to 6 releases of WordPress, including work in the *XML-RPC API* (in 3.4) and *WP_Image_Editor* class (in 3.5). I have also been involved in an upcoming release (3.9).
> 
> As we look toward the future of WordPress, it is important to evaluate current practices and trends within the WordPress user base, as well as the industry as a whole.

I agree with Marko that WordPress has a remarkable community, and I’m happy to have been involved in it for so long.

Some people would say that WordPress needs a simplified version, but that’s possible now thanks to various plugins.
