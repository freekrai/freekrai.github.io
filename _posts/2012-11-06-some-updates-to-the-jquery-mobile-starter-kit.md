Last night, I pushed some updates to the jQuery Mobile Starter kit.

It’s been updated to jQuery Mobile 1.2.0, and also now includes the [960 grid css](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-mobile-960/), which is handier than the built-in grid system for making nice-looking grid layouts.

I’m also working on setting up some downloadable themes for the kit, starting with the bootstrap theme that I’m currently using for an app project now, so watch for this starter kit to grow shortly.
