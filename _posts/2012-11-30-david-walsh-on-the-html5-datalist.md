> One of the most used JavaScript widgets over the past decade has been the text box autocomplete widget.  Every JavaScript framework has their own autocomplete widget and many of them have become quite advanced.  Much like the placeholder attribute’s introduction to markup, a frequently used functionality has been moved from a JavaScript-only utility to HTML via the new DATALIST element.

I actually started using this a short while ago, and find it pretty useful.. Cuts down on the extra work you usually do to get autocomplete to work using javascript..
