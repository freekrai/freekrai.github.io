> Google Talk — affectionally known as “Gchat” — is finally getting [replaced for good](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html). Google actually released Hangouts back in 2013 as a more feature-filled chat service take the place of Talk in the Gmail sidebar, but users have been able to stick with the older, more basic service if they chose.

> That’s changing on June 26th, when anyone still using Gchat will be forcibly transitioned over to Hangouts. It’s not a major change for most — there will still be chat built into Gmail, contacts will transition over, and Google has been trying to get people to switch over to Hangouts for the last four years, so maybe it’s time for Talk to go. The Google Talk Android app will also stop functioning, as will any third-party apps designed for Talk. (Again, anything using Hangouts — which is essentially the same thing — will still be fine.)

Gchat still existed? I actually thought most of that got rolled into Hangouts already.
