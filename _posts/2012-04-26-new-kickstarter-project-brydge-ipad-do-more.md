> Is it just us, or does it feel like the options for iPad keyboards and accessories are excessive in quantity, yet lacking in quality? This is why we created Brydge, which simply transforms your iPad into a laptop worthy of Apple.

> This idea of turning your iPad into a high quality laptop seemed obvious to us and we were shocked when we could not find any accessory that accomplished this. So we set out to make such a product from the highest quality materials that would compliment your iPad perfectly.

This project looks interesting, but their tag line of turning your iPad into a macBook Air isn’t entirely accurate.. You’re still running iOS, so really, you’re just making your iPad feel dressed up and think it’s a laptop.

He is right though, this is a overly populated market, Logitech actually makes several various iPad keyboards that do this same job.

Personally, I’m still quite happy with the [Origami Workstation](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/03/31/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2-and-ipad) I’ve mentioned before, and would be hard pressed to switch to this case.
