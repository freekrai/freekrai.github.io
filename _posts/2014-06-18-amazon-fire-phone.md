iPhone-like physical design, including the lack of logos from either Amazon or AT&T on the front face.

Also iPhone-like in pricing: $199 to start, with a two-year contract, and $650 without a contract for the 32 GB models.

The best feature sounds like the camera: f/2.0 lens (slightly faster than the iPhone 5S’s f/2.2) and optical image stabilization.

I would personally love to get my hands on one of these to see what it’s actually like, but my impression is that it seems most optimized for making it easy to buy things from Amazon.
