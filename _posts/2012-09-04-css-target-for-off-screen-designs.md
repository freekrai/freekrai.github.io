> I recently saw a presentation by Ryan Seddon on things you can do with checkboxes. It got me thinking about a similar pseudo selector based on the URL, :target, and how it could be used for hiding and revealing elements for extra space (namely on smaller screens). I set myself the task of recreating the iOS Message app without using JavaScript by taking full advantage of awesome CSS3 selectors and transitions.

Interesting article on using :target for screen designsâ€¦
