Nice tutorial on creating a FAQ section on your WordPress site.

> Creating an FAQ section for your WordPress website is incredibly simple. We’re going to use WordPress Custom Post Types for the questions & answers.

> Then we’ll use a jQuery UI accordion to make a nice cross-browser accordion widget. Finally we’ll assign a shortcode so that we can put our FAQ on any page or post.
