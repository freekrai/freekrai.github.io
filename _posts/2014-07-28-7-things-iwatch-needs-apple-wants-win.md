> We don’t know much of anything about Apple’s upcoming smartwatch, or even if such a thing exists. But as hype, rumors, and expectations reach the pre-release fever pitch we’ve come to associate with a new Apple product, it seems all but certain that Tim Cook [will take the stage this fall](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5825178/apple-iwatch-could-launch-in-october) to announce what Apple hopes is its next world-changing device.

>  It’s a long time coming. “I think the wrist is interesting,” Tim Cook said at the D Conference in 2011. “I’m wearing [a Nike Fuelband] on my wrist. It’s somewhat natural. But as I said before, I think for something to work here, you first have to convince people it’s so incredible that they want to wear it.”

>  Apple’s obviously not the only company trying to make an incredible product — from Samsung and Google to Pebble and CooKoo, many others are in the wristwear business. If Apple’s going to do right what all others have done wrong, it needs to quickly learn a number of important lessons. It needs the iWatch to do, and be, a few things like no other smartwatch.
