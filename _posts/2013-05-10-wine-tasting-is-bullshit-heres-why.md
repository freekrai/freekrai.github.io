Robert T. Gonzalez:

> The human palate is arguably the weakest of the five traditional senses. This begs an important question regarding wine tasting: is it bullshit, or is it complete and utter bullshit?There are no two ways about it: the bullshit is strong with wine. Wine tasting. Wine rating. Wine reviews. Wine descriptions. They’re all related. And they’re all egregious offenders, from a bullshit standpoint.

I’m sure it won’t be popular linking to this in the middle of Canada’s wine country where there is a winery on every corner almost.

I’ve actually found that I can tell the difference between different wines. So reading this article and it’s various tests are interesting..
