> [Samsung has confirmed](https://news.samsung.com/global/statement-on-galaxy-note7) that it is recalling the Galaxy Note 7, its newest smartphone, following reports that [some devices exploded](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/samsung-investigating-reports-of-galaxy-note-7-explosions/).
> 
> The device was launched less than a month ago to very positive reviews, but concerns about the battery in some units — which reportedly combusted while charging — have forced the company’s hand. Yesterday, Samsung confirmed it was investigating the issue, and now it has taken quick action to avoid potential tragedies.
> 
> Samsung said it has sold 2.5 million devices so far, and it plans to replace them all in “the coming weeks.” It added that it is aware of 35 cases of faulty batteries, although it isn’t clear how many of that number had exploded.
