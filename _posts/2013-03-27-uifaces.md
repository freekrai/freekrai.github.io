Avatars are a part of any community website/app and, if you ever found yourself hunting for them, here is a handy solution.

**[uiFaces](http://uifaces.com/)** is a website that **presents a list of avatars and allows us to customize them**.

The customization options are the **size of the image, spacing and the radius of it**.

Once the output looks good, we can just take a screenshot and use it in mockups. Something simple yet useful.
