Usually, I use Byword to edit the text files stored on Dropbox for this blog, but with the Nexus 7, I wanted to try to use that tablet as well..

The Play Store didn’t have any decent markdown editors that synced to Dropbox for this purpose, so I started researching and discovered what was actually the first app I installed..

The Dropbox app for Android has the ability to edit text files internally, something the iOS app doesn’t, so I missed it at first.

That means I can actually use my Nexus 7 tablet for creation as well as consumption if I wanted to.. Making the tablet just a little more useful.
