Adam Clarke Estes:

> Drones are fun. Let’s just get that out there. The small, semi-affordable aircraft that violate some people’s privacy, hurt others’ faces, and generally cause trouble are super duper fun. They’re also very, very complicated.

>  I know this, because I’ve spent the past year or so flying (and crashing) them. It was a long time coming, I guess. The ambition to become a hobby drone pilot stemmed in part from spending years writing about combat drones—mainly how awful and inhumane they are. Generally speaking, though, I’m a big technology enthusiast and always felt like easier access to unmanned aerial vehicles could be a really good thing. And I’ve since learned that it really is.

I’ve been flying a Parrot AR Done 2 for a while as a hobby, my daughter loves to chase after it, so I like reading about others trying the same thing.
