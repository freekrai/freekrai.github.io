My daughter loves candied pecans, and so do I.. But being diabetic, I wanted to find a less sweet way to make them..

Ingredients:
------------

- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 cup nuts
- 2 tbsp stevia (or splenda)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

Preparation:
------------

1. Melt butter in skillet.
2. Add everything else and cook gently over low heat until nuts are well coated and slightly crispy.
3. For extra crispy nuts, after cooking, place on cookie sheet and roast in preheated 350 degree oven for 5-6 minutes.
