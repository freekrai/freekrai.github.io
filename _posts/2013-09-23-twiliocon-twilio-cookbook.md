I was in San Francisco last week for TwilioCon 2013, where I got to meet some interesting people from Twilio and the Twilio community, and also launched my new book, [The Twilio CookBook](http://amzn.to/16tAjHV), which I published with [Pakt Publishing](http://goo.gl/bmN6VW).

The Twilio Cookbook was the result of months of writing on various topics related to Twilio, and covered nearly everything you can do with the Twilio API.

I was in attendance on Wednesday as Jeff Lawson told everyone about the book and officially launched it along with their new services:

- **1600 character message limit**: Previously, text messages had a limit of 160 characters, and we had to get creative for longer messages by breaking them up and including things like [1/2] at the end of the message.. Now.. Twilio supports up to 1600 characters in text messages.. This works out nicely..
- **Twilio Picture Messaging**: The ability to send pictures alongside text messages is a feature I’ve been asked for by clients for a while, and having this capability is a big thing. *I was actually in on this surprise as Twilio had contacted me to write a secret chapter for the book about Picture Messaging as a gift to all attendees*.
- **New Developer tools:**- **The Request Inspector** gives developers visibility into the HTTP requests and their responses during every phone call enabling them to identify failed and slow responses as well as showing the exact TwiML that Twilio executes.
- **The App Monitor** gives developers a consolidated real time view of all errors aggregated by error type that enables them to identify the most critical error, helping them focus on what’s most important. It also gives them the ability to drill down to identify the root cause and a time series of the error to put in context.
- **Usage Triggers** gives developers and sysadmins the ability to create email alerts or webhooks on daily, monthly or yearly thresholds of calls, messages or total spend. Making it easy to detect anomalous usage patterns.
- **Error Triggers** gives developers and sysadmins the ability to create email alerts or webhooks on daily, monthly or yearly thresholds of errors and warning. Making it easy to detect errors before their customers.
- **Data Compliance Account and Security Settings** including Limited Logging for the ability to switch the Request Inspector on/off, and enforced HTTP authentication on media URLs
- **Sip In & Out:** Twilio has supported SIP in for the past year, and they’ve now launched Sip out as well for outbound calls.
- [**Twilio.org**](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/09/a-billion-messages-for-good-twilio-org-launches-for-nonprofits.html): I like this one as Twilio.org helps empower non-profits to be able to use Twilio’s service for their service. Where Wednesday morning was for the developers, Thursday morning was for the community.

Finally, as part of the conference and book launch, I got to be on hand to pass out and sign copies of the Twilio Cookbook to all the attendees, which was a rush.

It was neat seeing people be excited about something I spent months making, and I watched the book table empty and get refilled several times over the two days we had it setup. I, in all honesty, have no idea how many copies I signed or people I talked to over Wednesday and Thursday, but it was great meeting everyone and answering any questions they had, ranging from what made me decide to write the book, to how I came up with the topics, to what I thought of the new announcements.

I flew home Friday morning, slightly tired, but also excited over the past week, and thinking of new ideas for the next book, as well as a few new ideas to build on. :)
