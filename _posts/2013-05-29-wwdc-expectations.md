Jim Dalrymple:

> Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is only a couple of weeks away and everyone is wondering what the company will unveil during the keynote address. As much as we all have long wish lists for what we would like to see, I think it’s important to balance those with realistic expectations for what’s likely to happen.
> 
> The important thing to remember about WWDC is that it is a developer conference. It’s not a place where Apple is going to show off the newest iPhone or iPad 1. These are Apple’s flagship products and they demand separate events. Entire industries watch these products because they shape what will happen in the mobile space. They are that important.
> 
> So, don’t expect an iPhone or iPad at WWDC.
> 
> If not an iPhone or iPad, what can we expect in the way of hardware from the conference? Personally, I would look squarely to the Mac side of Apple’s product line.
