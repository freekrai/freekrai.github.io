When presenting web or app prototypes to people (clients, collagues, friends..), showing it inside a real-world-like environment helps them to imagine easier.

**[PlaceIt](http://placeit.breezi.com/)** is a free service, created by the talented folks at Breezi, that allows you to upload the screenshot of your prototype and get it placed in different environments.

Screenshots can be uploaded with drag ‘n’ drops or mentioning the URL and the output will be rendered instantly.
