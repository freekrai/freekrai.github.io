Jim Dalrymple:

> Apple on Wednesday updated its iconic iPods with new colors and a host of new features for the iPod touch.
> 
> Apple went all out with the [iPod touch](http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/), giving the device the A8 chip, the same one used in the iPhone 6. Apple told me yesterday that the CPU in the new touch is six times faster than its predecessor and 10 times faster in graphics performance.
> 
> With its 4-inch display, iPod touch also gains support for [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), which gives it even more options to run powerful games. The touch also has the M8 motion co-processor, which tracks movement and other data for health and fitness apps.
> 
> Apple also made some significant changes to the cameras in the iPod touch. In addition to an 8 Megapixel camera, Apple updated the image sensor processor and added burst and slo-mo modes to the iPod touch.

Long overdue update to the iPod line...
