Matt Gemmell:

> No company has done as much damage to the perceived value of software, and the sustainability of being an independent developer, as Apple.

> Not that other companies wouldn’t have done the same thing — they would have. It’s just that Apple was the successful one.

> It’s resolutely the fault of us as consumers, and it’s actively encouraged by the App Store.

I'm not sure it's entirely only Apple that gets the blame for this though, as Google Play isn't much better, nor are any other app stores.
