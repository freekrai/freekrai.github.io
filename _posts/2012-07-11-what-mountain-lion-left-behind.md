Thomas Brand on some of the hardware, features, and names that OS X will be leaving out later this month when it’s released:

> For those of us already running Mac OS X Lion, Mountain Lion will be a minor update.
> 
> Continuing the iOSfication of Mac OS X, Mountain Lion brings even more apps and features back to Mac from our iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.
> 
> Unfortunately not everyone will be able to take advantage of the polish Apple’s latest cat provides.
> 
> Mountain Lion, like its predecessors will be leaving some Macs, and some Mac OS X features behind.
> 
> The list might not be as long as last year’s, but any feature worth using is a hard feature to lose.
