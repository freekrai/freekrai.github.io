Marco Arment:

> One of the biggest problems Microsoft will face with the Windows 8 platforms is that they’re effectively starting from zero apps. What can Microsoft do to encourage developers to create great Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 apps?

I have to agree here, it’s like what others have said as well.. Let’s leverage the fact that we have no apps, with cool things like a keyboard and track pad..

Look at Blackberry, they actually had to throw incentives like cash and free devices to get developers to start coding, and people still haven’t rushed to their platform…
