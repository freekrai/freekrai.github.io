> The official Raspberry Pi magazine just announced that over 12.5 million of the affordable little Linux boards have been sold since the original Pi was launched in 2012. [As The MagPi points out](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-sales/), this puts the Raspberry Pi past Commodore 64 sales, according to some estimates. 
> 
> That would make the Pi the third best-selling "general purpose computer" ever, behind Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows PCs. As commenters have pointed out, this isn't a precisely fair comparison, because there were other Commodore models than just the 64, but it's still a nice milestone all the same.

The Raspberry Pi 3 has the largest marketshare at 30% of overall sales. 

It's actually neat to see so many people buying Pis, they're handy little computers.
