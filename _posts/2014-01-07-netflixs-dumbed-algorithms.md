Felix Salmon:

> Netflix’s [big problem](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/24/the-problem-with-netflix/), it seems to me, is that it can’t afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch. It *could* try to buy streaming rights to every major Hollywood blockbuster in history — but doing so would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and could never be recouped with $7.99 monthly fees. What’s more, the studios can watch the Netflix share price as easily as anybody else, and when they see it ending 2013 at $360 a share, valuing the company at well over $20 billion, that’s their sign to start raising rates sharply during the next round of negotiations. Which in turn helps explain why Netflix is [losing so many great movies](http://flavorwire.com/388884/netflixs-streamageddon-why-do-streaming-video-services-still-suck/).

Since they can’t be our go-to for the latest and/or greatest movies, their strategy needs to be different. Good original content. Making it easier to find older/niche-like movies.

And it’s already working. I already think of Netflix as the place to go watch older movies, documentaries, indie movies, etc. And iTunes as where I snag the latest releases.
