Hardware-wise the Nexus 4 sounds very impressive, with a screen that rivals the iPhone 5 and a very cool idea for the back:

> Oh, and the back is made of glass — etched, layered glass that sparkles with a strange, almost holographic depth.

However, [the Nexus 4 doesn’t have LTE](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569688/why-nexus-4-does-not-have-4g-lte) and the phone will only be available direct from Google or through T-Mobile:

> Google has decided to forgo stricter carrier partnerships in the US, which for now means that the company will only offer the device as an unlocked HSPA+ phone. That’s a bit of a crushing blow to many, who expected Google’s next flagship phone to go toe-to-toe with the iPhone 5 and the latest crop of Windows Phone devices.
