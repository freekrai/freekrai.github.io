I’ve moved away from Feedburner and will now be sticking with just the built in RSS feed system.

Most of you that use Google Reader should roll over to the new feed (in theory) without having to do a thing. However if you don’t use Google Reader you will need to replace the Feedburner URL (if you are using it) with http://rogerstringer.com/rss

If readers have any issues, please let me know.
