> What do kids aged six to 12 want for Christmas this holiday season? Is it the highly-anticipated Nintendo Wii U? Sure, but much like everyone else, they want an Apple iPad more.
> 
> In fact, out of the top five products out there that kids want, four of them are from Apple: the iPad, the iPod touch, the iPad mini, and the iPhone. It makes sense for the phone product to be in last place, since many kids at that age simply don’t make that many calls, though I’m sure a few of them already know how to send a text.
