MG Siegler:

> Unlike most of the internet, I don’t tend to be one of those people who hates new features when they roll out simply because they’re different. [There are exceptions](https://500ish.com/twitter-still-exploring-53f6593843de#.m47dv9c9r), of course. But for the most part, I try to keep an open mind and often like many new features and fully recognize that even if I do not, any fervor over such changes is likely to subside quickly in the ever-shifting quicksands of internet time.

> Which is to say, I gave “Messenger Day” a few days. I still absolutely hate it.
