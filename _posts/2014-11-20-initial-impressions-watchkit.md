David Smith:

> Today Apple unveiled [WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/). I am very pleasantly surprised by how capable it is. In my [Expectations for WatchKit](http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/11/06/expectations-for-watchkit/) article I outlined that I thought we’d see a two phase roll-out of the platform. Starting with pretty limited capabilities that would then be expanded at next year’s WWDC. It turns out that I was only half correct. It is two phase but the first phase is much more capable than I was expecting.

>  In the first phase we will be able to build Glances, Actionable Notifications and iPhone powered apps. The last of which has me most excited.
