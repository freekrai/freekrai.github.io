I do a lot of work with Phonegap and jQuery Mobile among other frameworks, so I find it handy to have your tools on hand when you start building a new project.

And that is exactly what this starter kit is.. It may not be perfect for everyone, but it works for me. So I’m sharing it for everyone else to use.
