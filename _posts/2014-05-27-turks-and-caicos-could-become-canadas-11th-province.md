> The premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands is in Ottawa tomorrow promoting economic ties, but there’s a dream of annexing the island and turning it into Canada’s Hawaii.
> 
> If Conservative MP Peter Goldring gets his way, the archipelago of 40 Caribbean islands located east of Cuba would be Canada’s 11th province.
> 
> > Canada really needs a Hawaii. The United States has a Hawaii. Why can’t Canada have a Hawaii?  
> >  —Peter Goldring

> Goldring notes that Ottawa is actually closer to the islands (in kilometres) than his Edmonton riding.  
>  There have been at least three attempts over many decades to have the sun-splashed British overseas territory officially join Canada.

> However, those attempts have been repeatedly rebuffed either by Canadian or British officials.
