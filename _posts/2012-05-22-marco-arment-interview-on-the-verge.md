> Marco Arment talks about the early days of Tumblr, living on a farm, and why he only makes an iOS version of Instapaper. Watch the full episodes at *[on.theverge.com](http://www.theverge.com/on-the-verge)*

Marco Arment was a guest for the latest episode of *[On The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/on-the-verge)*. I enjoyed the whole 20-minute segment but it gets especially great when Marco and Joshua start bantering about Android and iOS. Josh is well known for his Android love and Marco is well known for his iOS love, so itâ€™s interesting to compare.
