Charles Arthur:

> Apple’s expected “iPad mini” will only come in a Wi-Fi version — but there will also be a revised version of the iPad with 4G connectivity compatible with the UK’s Everything Everywhere network, and sporting the new “Lightning” connector, industry sources have told the Guardian.

It’s possible, but I’d still bet on the iPad Mini having some sort of LTE option like its bigger sibling.
