> On Wednesday, the company announced its intentions to develop original comedy and children shows that will be distributed by way of its online streaming service, Amazon Instant Video.
> 
> “Amazon Studios wants to discover great talent and produce programming that audiences will love,” Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, said in a release.
> 
> “In the course of developing movies, we’ve heard a lot of interest from content creators who want to develop original series in the comedy and children’s genres. We are excited to bring  
>  writers, animators and directors this new opportunity to develop original series.”

This could be interesting, it’s an approach netflix has already been taking with a few new series they’ve created.

I guess next Apple will start their own original programming for the apple tv?
