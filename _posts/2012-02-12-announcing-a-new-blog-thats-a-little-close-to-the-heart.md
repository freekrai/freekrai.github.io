Today I’ve decided to announce my latest blog… [The D Word](http://thedword.me) is a blog I started a couple weeks ago to use as a note area more than anything as I adjust to my recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. It’s become a place to find links, updates and even diabetic friendly recipes as I’ve found them. I admit this blog is a little different, but it’s one I felt I wanted to get out there as I work my way down this journey.
