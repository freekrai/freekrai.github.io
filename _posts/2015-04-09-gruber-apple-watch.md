John Gruber:

> Apple Watch is, in many ways, the [Bizarro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcjSDZNbOs0) iPhone — in some ways parallel and similar, but in others, the inverse, the opposite.
> 
> Both were introduced as three things in one. [Steve Jobs, introducing the iPhone back in 2007](http://genius.com/Steve-jobs-iphone-keynote-2007-annotated): “The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.” [Tim Cook, introducing the Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/live/2015-mar-event/): “In addition to being a beautiful object, Apple Watch is the most advanced timepiece ever created, it’s a revolutionary new way to connect with others, and it’s a comprehensive health and fitness companion.”

> An iPod, a phone, and an “Internet communicator”.
> 
> A watch, a “new way to connect with each other”, and a health and fitness companion.
>
> The iPhone did more than just those things. Apple Watch does more than just these things. But with both devices, Apple framed our introduction to these fundamentally new products with similar “it does three main things” formulations. The reason seems clear: to simplify complex products, and to root something new and unknown in old and familiar contexts.

I've mentioned before that I'm not new to smart watches, I've been using my Pebble for a while now, and the usage being shown for the Apple Watch is along similar lines to what I use my Pebble for.

I'm actually more looking forward to the interface the Apple Watch has, and more in terms of just how the watch handles everything compared to more simplistic approach the Pebble uses.
