Ben Sandofsky:

We're in the run-up to WWDC, and in the wake of this [announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/17276) from Chris Lattner a week ago, that certain features slated for the upcoming Swift 3.0 have been postponed, I expect to see a ton of pieces on Swift and dynamic programming. 

Sandofsky's article is a great overview of why it might not be practical — arguments over dynamism aside — for big apps to move to Swift yet.
