Charles Arthur, The Guardian:

> Still, there’s an [eWeek article](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/Netbook-Sales-to-More-than-Double-by-2013-ABI-864854/) from July in which ABI says that “consumer interest in netbooks shows no sign of waning, and the attraction remains the same: value rather than raw performance.”

> Actually, the number sold in 2013 will be very much closer to zero than to 139m. The Taiwanese tech site Digitimes points out that Asus, which kicked off the modern netbook category with its Eee PC in 2007, has announced that it won’t make its Eee PC product after today, and that Acer doesn’t plan to make any more; which means that “the netbook market will officially end after the two vendors finish digesting their remaining inventories.”

I actually owned a couple of the original Eee netbooks when they first came out.. They worked pretty well for such a small size machine.
