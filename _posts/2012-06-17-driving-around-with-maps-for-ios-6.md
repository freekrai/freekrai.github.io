> Much of the excitement in iOS6 centers on the new Maps app. It replaces the Google Maps-powered version that’s been part of iOS since the beginning
> 
> The revamped Maps adds Flyover (3D aerial perspectives) for some cities; it also offers spoken turn-by-turn navigation, a feature that the old Maps never offered for iOS but that Google baked into Android phones. Maps in iOS 6 also integrates Siri for search on supported devices. Unfortunately, only newer devices get the snazzy features; turn-by-turn requires an iPhone 4S or an iPad (2 or new), for example, and obviously Siri is only available on the 4S & soon the new iPad.

Nice look at the new Maps app in iOS 6….
