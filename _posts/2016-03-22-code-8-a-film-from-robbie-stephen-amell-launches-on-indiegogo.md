Acting cousins Stephen (from Arrow) & Robbie (Flash, Tomorrow People, X-files) Amell just launched their 10 minute short film titled [Code 8](http://code8.com) and they also launched an [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/code-8-a-film-from-robbie-stephen-amell#/) campaign to raise funds to make it into a feature film.

The movie puts us in a near future that has 4% of the population endowed with powers of some sort. Due to this and the skewed poverty line, the police have militarized, equipping robots and drones to help them keep the peace. The short film is fantastic and definitely worth a look.

They've got an interesting line up between the two of them, Sung Kang (Fast & Furious movies), Aaron Abrams (Hannibal, Blindspot), Chad Donella (Scandal), and Alfred Rubin Thompson (Club Dead).

I really liked the 10 minute short film, and am rooting for the feature film to get made.
