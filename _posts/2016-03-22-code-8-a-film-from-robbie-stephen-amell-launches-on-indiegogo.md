Acting cousins Stephen (from Arrow) & Robbie (Flash, Tomorrow People, X-files) Amell just launched their 10 minute short film titled [Code 8](http://code8.com) and also launched an [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/code-8-a-film-from-robbie-stephen-amell#/) campaign to raise funds to make it into a feature film.

They've got an interesting line between the two of them, Sung Kang (Fast & Furious movies), Aaron Abrams (Hannibal, Blindspot), Chad Donella (Scandal), and Alfred Rubin Thompson (Club Dead).

I liked the 10 minute short film, and am rooting for the feature film to get made.
