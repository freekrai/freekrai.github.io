After I reviewed the [Ultrathin keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/06/12/ultrathin-keyboard-cover) from Logitech, it was recommended that I also take a look at the Logtech Tablet Keyboard for iPad..

So last week, I received my review unit and started using it..

End result..

I like it, I like the freedom of being able to adjust the viewing angles, and having the keyboard not attached to the iPad..

But.. it’s back to where you are with the [Origami](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/03/31/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2-and-ipad), where you end up carrying around the iPad and the keyboard seperately, which is one thing I like about the Ultrathin.

Typing on this keyboard is pretty quick, and the keyboard’s shortcut keys work well, but I still like my origami better, when it comes down to this keyboard versus the other one.

But I do recommend this keyboard if you want a nice flexible tablet keyboard.
