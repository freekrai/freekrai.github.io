Reuters:

> Many developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames. Google Inc itself has pushed back the Glass roll out to the mass market.
> 
>  While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim, many developers say.
> 
>  Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. Three more have switched to developing for business, leaving behind consumer projects.

As a Google Glass user, I’ve enjoyed using my Google Glass, but I’ve also never really seen it as a consumer product. I can see various vertical markets for Glass, and I think this will turn out to have been a good investment for Google.

I think that to catch on in the consumer space though, Google will have to pivot and find another form factor that is friendlier, less threatening.
