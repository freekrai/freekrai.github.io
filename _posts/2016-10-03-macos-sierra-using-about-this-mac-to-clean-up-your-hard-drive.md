For starters, you can tap Applications (in the sidebar), then tap the Last Accessed header to list Applications in reverse order, which will show you the apps you haven’t accessed in a long time. The longest neglected app I found on my Mac was iPod Software 2.1 Updater.app, which I haven’t touched since 2003.

I routinely run `CleanMyMac` on my macbook and this still found a few gigs that CleanMyMac missed (such as old GarageBand instruments and I removed GarageBand a long time ago).
