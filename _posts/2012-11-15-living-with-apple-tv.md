Ben Popper, for The Verge

> I’ve always held a grudge against Apple devices, yet somehow I’ve come to own nothing else. My first smartphone was a Motorola Droid. I had it for two years. In that time, I probably spent a total of $10 on apps. I spent more than that on my first day with an iPhone.
> 
> My first connected TV device was an original Boxee Box. After that I added an Xbox 360. My latest purchase was an Apple TV, and I managed to spend more on films and TV in the first few months than I had in my two years with the Boxee or Xbox. Clearly, Apple knows how to make a slick, seamless store that anyone can learn to navigate easily, and as someone who would rather be working a little harder and getting the goods for free, I kind of hate them for that.
> 
> Boxee, for example, offered lots of great options for free content, ranging from video from Vice magazine or new TED talks, all served up as well-designed apps. Apple TV requires I load up the Podcast app, search for TED, click my way through lots of generic results, choose from a dozen different TED modules, and finally select my episode, most of which are presented largely without any description.
> 
> Apple’s priority is to be the best media merchant, not the most flexible or interesting internet-connected set top box. Spending a week with only the Apple TV reminded me that it’s still largely lacking some crucial elements — gaming, live sports and news, and a variety of free entertainment apps. But at $99, I have to admit, Apple TV delivers a strong overall package at an affordable price with a great interface and just a few rough patches.

Myself being a user of Apple Tv, Boxee Box Roku, and Xbox, I can agree on what Ben’s saying in this article.
