Coda 2 launched today (actually, last night), and it’s had a ton of requested features. I mentioned it’s upcoming release a couple days ago, and it’s nice to see it out today.

> So, you code for the web. And in Coda 1, we revolutionized that process, and put everything you needed in one place. An editor. Terminal. CSS. File management. SVN. But we knew we could do more.
> 
> Now, with Coda 2, we went beyond expectations. We added tons of highly-requested features, and a few nobody expected, then wrapped it all up in a shiny, groundbreaking UI fit for the future.

Today it’s half-price from Panic’s site or the Mac App Store.

And the new, perfectly named [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda/) for iPad is a pretty nice app as well.

I’m a fan of Panic, as I’ve mentioned on here before. I’ve actually used Coda for the last 2 years as my main editor, simply because of the built-in source control and the handy file manager. I also use Transmit and Prompt from them as well.
