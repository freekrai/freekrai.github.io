For anyone brave enough to give it a try,  Apple has opened up the doors and released the first public beta of iOS 11, the developer beta of iOS 11 has been out since June 5 when it was released at WWDC. 

iOS 11 includes [many new features](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-11-preview/) such as a new Files app that makes navigating files on iOS devices easier than in the past and adds several iPad-only features like drag & drop, an app Dock, and enhanced multitasking.

You can go ahead and sign up for the beta program [here](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome), but follow the instructions, which include backing up your iOS device, because itâ€™s still early in the iOS 11 beta release cycle. 

There **will** be bugs and running a beta always runs the risk of data loss.
