This morning, Apple has begun accepting orders for the iPad Mini with Retina Display, with shipping beginning in 1-3 business days.

No word on when retailers will begin selling the tablet but chances are good that it will be this week.

The updated iPad Mini comes with retina display and an A7 processor, putting it on par with itâ€™s bigger brother the iPad Air, which was released a little over a week ago.
