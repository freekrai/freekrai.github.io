That didn’t take long, and I’m not surprised…

ZAGG is now taking pre-orders for iPad mini keyboard cases, hoping to turn the iPad Mini into a business powerhouse. The [ZAGGkeys Mini 7](http://www.zagg.com/accessories/zaggkeys-mini-ipad-keyboard-case.php#7) (US$89.99) is an exact match to the dimensions of the iPad mini and uses “island-style keys in a sleek and unique layout provide maximum finger space in a compact Bluetooth keyboard, perfect for accentuating the utility and convenience of iPad mini.”

On top of that, if you’d actually prefer a keyboard with some room for your fingers, the [ZAGGkeys Mini 9](http://www.zagg.com/accessories/zaggkeys-mini-ipad-keyboard-case.php#9) (also $89.99) may do the trick. According to ZAGG, it features “island-style keys with a carefully engineered layout to provide the same spacing as ZAGG’s traditional tablet keyboard.”

Although the Mini 7 is a tiny keyboard, it still provides special function keys for “volume control, play, pause, screen lock, home, search, slideshow, copy, paste and more.” No word on if it’s actually large enough to type on, but I’ll be reviewing it in the near future, so I’ll let everyone know.
