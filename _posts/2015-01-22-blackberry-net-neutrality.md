John Chen, in a blog post adapted from a letter he sent to several members of Congress:

> Unfortunately, not all content and applications providers have embraced openness and neutrality. Unlike BlackBerry, which allows iPhone users to download and use our BBM service, Apple does not allow BlackBerry or Android users to download Apple’s iMessage messaging service.

Ok…

Let’s set aside the assertion that net neutrality [^1] means Apple should be forced to support iMessage on BlackBerry and Android phones.

This is a really bizarre argument, being made from a company in a position of weakness: “Why won’t they share their toys?” Do you think BlackBerry would have been in a hurry to share its technology with Apple back when BlackBerry was riding high?

In fact, for years, BlackBerry was entirely against sharing their BBM app with other platforms until they started losing their footing and finally had no other choice.


[^1]: Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003 as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier.
