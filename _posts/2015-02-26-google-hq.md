Conor Dougherty, reporting for the NYT:

> Google owns or leases about 7.3 million square feet of office space in Mountain View â€” roughly equivalent to three Empire State Buildings. That includes most of the property around its headquarters on the north side of the city near Highway 101, which cuts the length of the valley, according to Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage.
