> What happens when you combine a pocket camera with an Android smartphone? Samsung’s answer is the Galaxy Camera. Running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean on a massive 4.8-inch HD LCD display, the Galaxy Camera aims to take the best of Samsung’s camera and phone departments and mix them up for something altogether unique. There’s a 16-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor within what is otherwise an unmistakably camera-shaped body, equipped with a retractable lens that provides 21x optical zoom.

There’ve been a few Android-powered cameras announced this week, it’s an interesting move.. And seems better than bring Android to the TV, which hasn’t gone all that well so far..
