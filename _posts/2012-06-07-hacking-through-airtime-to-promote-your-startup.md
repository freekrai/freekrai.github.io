> Morning time, still in bed reading tech news headlines about the recent launch of Airtime. I waited for this a long time and couldn’t wait to see how they built it. One hour later at the office I finally sit down to play around with the new toy. Everything seems beautiful and right and I didn’t expect anything less. I Hit “Talk to someone” and wait to see what’s next. Judging by the interface’s resemblance to Chatroulette, you can guess what I was expecting to see. All of a sudden this familiar guy shows up on my screen. “Hi, I’m Gary Vaynerchuk, how are you?”

> OMG.

Interesting reading about Noam’s first day spent playing with airtime and the various people he encountered.
