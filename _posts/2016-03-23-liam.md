Samantha Murphy Kelly, writing for Mashable:

> Liam completes an iPhone disassembly process every 11 seconds, with dozens running through the system at all times. About 350 units are turned around each hour, equivalent to 1.2 million iPhones each year. Apple wouldnâ€™t say when Liam started its work, but emphasized the project is still in the research and development stages.
