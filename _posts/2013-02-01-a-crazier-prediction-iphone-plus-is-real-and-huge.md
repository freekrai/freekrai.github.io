> So far, I’m betting on [an A5X-powered Retina iPad Mini](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/31/appletv-a5xr2) by this fall. While I’m making semi-crazy predictions about future iOS products so I can look back on this in a year and probably feel like an idiot for being so wrong, here’s one more.
> 
> The recently rumored, larger-screened “iPhone Math”, or more likely “iPhone Plus”, is plausible as an additional model (not a replacement) alongside the 4” iPhone. And there’s a good chance that it would have a 4.94”, 16:9 screen.
> 
> The theory is easy to understand: perform [John Gruber’s Mini-predicting math](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/04/bloomberg-ipad-mini)backwards. The iPad Mini uses iPhone 3GS-density screens at iPad resolution. What if an iPhone Plus used Retina iPad screens with iPhone 5 resolution, keeping the rest of the design sized like an iPhone 5?
> 
> Its 640 × 1136, 264 DPI screen would measure 4.94” diagonally, and it would look roughly like this next to an iPhone 5

Interesting speculation from Marco Arment. These larger screen smartphones are selling better than I would have expected, so it’s possible..
