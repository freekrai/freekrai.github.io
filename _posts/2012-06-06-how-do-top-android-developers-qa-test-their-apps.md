Interesting article about how several Android shops test their apps on multiple devices…

I’ve been doing some Android development lately, and I’ve found myself testing on 3 phones and 1 tablet and each phone giving different results… A Motorola Atrix 4G, A Samsung Gio, and an LG Eclypse, as well as a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.

For more hardcore shops, I can definitely see how you’d end up with 20-30 or more devices to test on…
