Fred Imbert, CNBC:

> GoPro is having a good day. The wearable camera maker’s stock surged more than 19 percent Wednesday and the company announced it hired Daniel Coster away from Apple as vice president of design.
> 
> Coster was a core member of Apple’s industrial design team for more than 20 years and is credited with contributing to devices such as iPhone 4 and iPad wireless keyboard, the company said in a statement.
 
It's interesting that hiring a single designer could have this type of effect, even if it is just a temporary stock price spike.

But, Coster does has his work cut out for him. 

I've had GoPro cameras, and they are sorely disappointing.
