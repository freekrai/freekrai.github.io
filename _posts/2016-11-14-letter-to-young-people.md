Marco Arment: 

> The strongest despair I’ve heard about this election has come from high school and college students. I don’t know if this will really help anyone, and I hope it’s not patronizing. But just in case it helps:
> 
> George W. Bush was elected during my freshman year of college. For the next 8 years — all of college, my first job, and the first two years of Tumblr — we suffered through that horrific administration. It was half of my adult life so far.
> 
> It felt hopeless. It felt like we’d never have a functional government again. It felt like the damage would be irreparable. It felt like the good side lost and would never win again.
> 
> [..]
> 
> In the meantime, do everything you can to help, support, and stand up for the millions of people whose country just let them down, many of whom live in homes and communities that have just become unwelcoming or unsafe.
> 
> We’ll get our chance to repair the damage and move forward again, and you’ll bring us there.
> 
> Hang in there.

I wanted to share some snippets of Marco's post that he wrote on Friday, as it's really good.

And it's true, a lot of people have been wondering where things will go from here after last week's election, but all anyone can do is wait and see and just `hang in there` as Marco put it.
