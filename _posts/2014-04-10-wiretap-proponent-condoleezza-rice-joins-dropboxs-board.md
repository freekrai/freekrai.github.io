Brian Feldman, writing for The Wire:

> Tucked away near the end of a [Businessweek article](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-09/dropboxs-next-chapter-corporate-customers-ipo-condi-rice-and-eddie-vedder#p3) on the startup is news of Rice taking a fourth seat on the board:
> 
> > The former secretary of state’s consulting firm, RiceHadleyGates, has been advising the startup on management issues for the last year. Now she’ll help the company think about such matters as international expansion and privacy, an issue that dogs every cloud company in the age of Edward Snowden and the NSA.
> 
> You know, privacy and the NSA. The same NSA that, as [Ars Technica points out](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/04/dropbox-adds-new-mailbox-clients-photo-syncing-and-condoleezza-rice/), [Rice herself authorized](http://rawstory.com/news/2005/After_domestic_spying_reports_U.S._spying_1227.html) to wiretap UN officials and [other domestic targets](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/18/bush.nsa/) without warrants. She definitely seems like the right person to help craft Dropbox’s privacy policies.

This seems like an oddly tone-deaf move for Dropbox, in the post-Snowden world. Is not warrantless government eavesdropping the single biggest concern people have regarding Dropbox?
