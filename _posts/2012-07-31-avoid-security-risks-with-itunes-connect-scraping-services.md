Marco wrote a nice article about how to set up a sales users in iTunes Connect for use with services like [App Annie](http://www.appannie.com/), [AppFigures](http://www.appfigures.com/) or [AppViz](http://www.ideaswarm.com/AppViz2.html)..

Handy to remember as Iâ€™ve had to walk a few clients through this same process over the past month or two.
