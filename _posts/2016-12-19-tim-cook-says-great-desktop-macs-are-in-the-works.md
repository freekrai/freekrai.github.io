> Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company’s commitment to desktop Mac computers remains strong, despite a glaring omission of the product line in a slate of recent MacBook announcements. Cook’s comments on the manner were posted to Apple’s internal employee message board, which were then [obtained and verified by TechCrunch today](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-ensures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/).
> 
> Here’s what Cook had to say in response to a question about whether Mac desktops were strategic for Apple:
> 
> > The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people.
> > 
> > The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world.
> > 
> > Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.
> 
> It’s unclear if Cook is referencing just the company’s iMac all-in-one line, or if he also intended his statement to include the Mac mini and the Mac Pro. But the lack of updates to all three is a genuine concern for fans of Apple’s desktop computers.
