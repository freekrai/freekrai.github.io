Tina Brown and Baba Shetty outlining the Newsweek transition to all digital:

> Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night. But as we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purposeâ€”and embrace the all-digital future.

Tdoay, Newsweek has gone from being a print / digital magazine to being an all-digital format. This is being done with a single global edition focusing on original content backed by a subscriber model. I love this move and applaud the Newsweek team for recognizing that such a move is needed.
