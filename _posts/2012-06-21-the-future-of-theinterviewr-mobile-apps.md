Posted this on TheInterviewr blog earlier today:

> The original iPhone app for TheInterviewr was built in partnership with another company that uses our API to do the work.
> 
> We’ve been working on our own inhouse android app ourselves in the past couple months, and have decided to move the TheInterviewr iPhone app inhouse as well.
> 
> This will give us more control over the app, as well as let us add new features such as managing your contacts, etc.
> 
> We will also be making the new app iPad friendly as well for everyone to enjoy.
> 
> Our goal with this is to make everyone’s experience more enjoyable and usable, as always.
> 
> It’s gonna be a fun summer over here so thanks for joining us.
