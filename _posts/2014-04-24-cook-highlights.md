Here’s my favourite part of the whole transcript:

> The key thing that…for us, is to stay focused on things that we can do best and that we can perform at a really high level of quality that our customers have come to expect.
> 
> And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the number of things we’re working on. We’ve been doing that in the background, and we’re not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain.
> 
> But we’ve got some great things there that we’re working on that I’m very very proud of and very, very excited about.
> 
> But for us, we care about every detail, and when you care about every detail and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that. And that’s always been the case—that’s not something that just occurred, you know.
> 
> As you probably know from following us for a long time, we didn’t ship the first MP3 player, nor the first smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a decade or so before then, but arguably we shipped the first successful modern tablet, the first successful modern smartphone, and the first successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it right, than to be first.
> 
> I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace where it’s clear that the objective has been to be first. But customers, at the end of the day, don’t care about that, or that’s not what they look for from Apple—they want great, insanely great, and that’s what we want to deliver. And so that’s the way we look at it.
