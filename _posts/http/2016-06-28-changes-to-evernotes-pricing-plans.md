Evernote’s [Chris O’Neill has published a blog post](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/06/28/changes-to-evernotes-pricing-plans/) explaining price increases coming to the platform. Plus and Premium are now $3.99 and $7.99 a month, respectively, with discounts for annual buyers. For those customers, Plus is now $10 more a year, while Premium has gone up $20.

But, the big change is this:

> Beginning today, the prices for our Plus and Premium tiers will change for new subscriptions, and access from Evernote Basic accounts will be limited to two devices. Current subscribers and Basic users who are using more than two devices will have some time to adjust before the changes take effect. If you are impacted, look for a message from us in the coming days.

Basically, if you use an iPhone, iPad and a Mac (or if you have an iPad and an iPad Mini for example), you will now need to pay for Evernote. 

I was an avid Evernote user, but with the changes to the Notes.app last year, I've moved almost entirely to Notes and just use Evernote to go back to old notes mostly.
