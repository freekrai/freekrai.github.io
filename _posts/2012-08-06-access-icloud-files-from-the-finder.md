A handy tip on where to locate the iCloud files locally on your Mac..

A great tip on where to locate the iCloud files locally on your Mac. As noted in the tip, Finder even changes to say ?iCloud? in the title bar when you open this folder.

Oddly you cannot add this folder to the Finder sidebar, so if anyone knows how to do that ? I would love to know.

Also in looking at this the Apple apps seems to have fairly clean looking folder names, but the rest of the apps have a string of characters before them ? I wonder if this is Apple ?cheating? or if there is something developers can do to get a cleaner looking name
