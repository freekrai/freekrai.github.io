Charles Arthur:

> Ever since it was announced that the Galaxy S6 wouldn’t offer either a removable battery or a microSD slot, there was all sorts of kerfuffle on tech blogs, and the comments therein: people said that they bought Samsung stuff specifically for those elements, and that those were key things which set them apart from the (reviled, in their eyes) iPhone range, which has never offered a removable battery or slot-in storage.

> However, I’m pretty sure that Samsung’s move is not only idealistic — not having to make the back removable avoids all sorts of design compromises — but also driven by clear data.

Samsung is finally changing sides as they realize swappable batteries are not a meaningful mass market selling point.
