[Yesterday, Google](https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/08/flash-and-chrome.html?m=1) announced that its Chrome browser will begin blocking Flash that runs in the background of webpages in September and make HTML5 the ‘default Chrome experience’ in December. 

According to Google:

> Today, more than 90% of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, [Chrome 53 will begin to block it](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-dev/QL2K4yFVg_U/vj44YWOaAwAJ). 
> 
> HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites.
> …
> In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience, except for sites which only support Flash.

 This is about time, I actually block Flash on my desktop browsers, so it's nice to see this catching up.
