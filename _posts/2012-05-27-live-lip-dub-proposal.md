> On Wednesday, May 23rd, 2012, I told my girlfriend to meet me at my parent’s house for dinner. When she arrived I had stationed my brother to sit her in the back of an open Honda CRV and give her some headphones. He “wanted to play her a song”…
> 
> What she got instead was the world’s first Live Lip-Dub Proposal.

This proposal was a whole lot more exciting that mine was to be honest.. My wife and I got engaged 6 years ago this July sitting on a beach watching fireworks, and she knew it was coming since she had picked out the ring herself two months before that.
