>   09-18/hey-android-users-dont-buy-the-new-iphones)” — is profoundly shallow:

Apple’s operating system may be more intuitive to someone who has never touched a smartphone before, but it’s not going to be any easier for people who have spent over an hour staring at their Android phone every day for the last two to four years. Any benefits are probably outweighed by the drawbacks to abandoning the investment someone has already made.

The move to cloud-based storage and syncing makes a lot of things less sticky. Gmail is Gmail. Dropbox is Dropbox. You can even access your iCloud email from Android, because it’s just IMAP. Add to that the fact that the overwhelming majority of mobile apps are free or extremely cheap.

> [Apple has posted a guide on switching](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6407?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) from Android to iPhone, and it’s really pretty straightforward. Google could just as easily post a guide on switching from iPhone to Nexus. Brustein’s advice, to me, seems like an endorsement of laziness, ignorance, and tribalism.

> [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) watches are cross-platform, but look at how severely limited they are in functionality compared to Android Wear and Apple Watch. And that’s not a slag against Pebble. They’re shipping. They’ve been shipping. And they have some devoted and happy users. And by doing so much less, they’re able to measure battery life in days instead of hours. But functionality-wise, something like Pebble is what you get if you set out to create something that works across iOS and Android, limited by the sandboxing rules for third-party apps. Apple Watch and Android Wear require software on the phone at the operating system level. Mobile apps can only provide shallow integration. To get deep integration requires software (and hardware) designed in coordination. Brustein’s argument is not too far removed from saying that we should be able to buy a Toyota Prius with a Tesla engine — like you can just mix and match these things like Lego bricks.

I agree with everything Gruber said except he’s a bit wrong about the Pebble.. What you could do pre-iOS 7 was far more limited than what you could do once iOS 7 launched, and with iOS 8, you have more options.

With the pebble, notifications work extremely well, and communications with other apps work well too, the only real limitation is Siri, but some people have found ways around that too.

You even have camera controls and maps access thanks to apps like PebbGPS and PebbleCam.

One other thing Gruber added:

> POSTSCRIPT: Keep in mind too that Google’s and Apple’s rivalry is asymmetric. Google is a very active, very popular developer of native iOS apps. They don’t treat iOS as a second-class platform — if anything, they’re more interested in iOS users because they’re a more lucrative demographic for advertisers. Apple’s only Android app is the one they bought with Beats Music. I think Google would support Android Wear from iPhone if they could, and who knows, maybe I’m underestimating just how much a background app can do in iOS 8. But even if Google unveils iPhone support for Android Wear, that too would only prove that Android Wear has nothing to do with trying to lock users in to Android.

Google makes apps for the Google Glass to work on iOS, so I can see them eventually adding an app to use Android Wear, or else building it directly into their Google Search app which has Google Now already. Of course, not enough people are using Glass, so I think that’s been kept a small secret.

And thinking back on this.. I can definitely see Google making an Android Wear app for iOS.. Maybe around the launch date of the Apple Watch possibly?
