> Swagway, one of the leading hoverboard sellers in the country, is telling customers to stop using its devices after the US Consumer Products Safety Commission deemed [nearly all hoverboards unsafe](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/19/11060836/hoverboard-risk-letter-safety-certification-fire-cpsc) yesterday.

>  The CPSC's letter — sent to manufacturers, importers, and sellers of the self-balancing two-wheeled scooters — says the devices pose an "imminent hazard" and may be seized or recalled by the government.

> Anyone caught selling unlicensed hoverboards risks civil and criminal penalties, according to the US government

Hoverboards were a big craze here last summer, a couple local rental companies were renting them out for kids (and adults) to ride along the beaches along with the usual bikes, paddle boards, kayaks, etc.

I don't see a bright future in hoverboard rentals this summer though.
