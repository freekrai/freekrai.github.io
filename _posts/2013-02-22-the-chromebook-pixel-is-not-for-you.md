Nathan Edwards for the Wirecutter:

> Google just announced its first premium Chromebook, the [Chromebook Pixel.](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-chromebook-pixel-for-whats-next.html) It’s gorgeous. Unfortunately, it’s so expensive that I can’t think of a single person who should get one.

[At least one person has ordered one so far.](https://plus.google.com/+JeffJarvis/posts/g9gcXLPuVVQ)
