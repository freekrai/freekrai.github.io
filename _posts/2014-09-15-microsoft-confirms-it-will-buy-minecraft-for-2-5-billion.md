> Microsoft is buying Minecraft maker Mojang. Reports of Microsoft’s plans surfaced nearly a week ago, and the software maker is making it official today. Microsoft is paying $2.5 billion to acquire Mojang, and the deal is expected to close by the end of the year. “Minecraft adds diversity to our game portfolio and helps us reach new gamers across multiple platforms,” says Xbox chief Phil Spencer. “Gaming is the top activity across devices and we see great potential to continue to grow the Minecraft community and nurture the franchise. That is why we plan to continue to make Minecraft available across platforms – including iOS, Android and PlayStation, in addition to Xbox and PC.”

> Minecraft creator Markus Persson, known as Notch, will not be joining Microsoft as part of the acquisition. “He’s decided that he doesn’t want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance,” says Mojang’s Owen Hill. “Over the past few years he’s made attempts to work on smaller projects, but the pressure of owning Minecraft became too much for him to handle. The only option was to sell Mojang. He’ll continue to do cool stuff though. Don’t worry about that.” Notch has previously criticized Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system, but in a revealing blog post he discusses his reasons for leaving Mojang and Minecraft. “If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately,” says Persson.”Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big.”

I’m not surprised that Notch will be leaving Mojang as part of this purchase..

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go uninstall Minecraft from every device in the house.
