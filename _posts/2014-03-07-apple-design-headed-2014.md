Dave Wiskus, writing for Macworld:

> As it stands now, iOS 7 is a series of solvable problems. The things you could label as deficiencies are mostly a result of that swinging pendulum — an overcorrection of skeuomorphism. So what comes next is most likely balance and refinement. Buttons might not need to look like they’re being physically pressed if you tap them, but some feedback is useful. Text-label buttons (such as *Send* in Messages) don’t need to be visually heavy, but it’s generally better to give users a sense of tap target size.

I think it’s clear that a change will happen to OS X this year, but I’m not convinced you can look at iOS 7 and predict what a corresponding refresh of OS X will look like.
