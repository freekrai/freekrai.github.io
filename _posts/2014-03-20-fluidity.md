Adam Morse has an interesting site where he demonstrates that the web is responsive right out of the box. With no authored CSS at all, a website will flow to whatever screen width is available.

If your site isn’t responsive, *you* broke it.

Well that’s almost true, but as Adam Morse says in this new project:

> HTML is **almost** 100% responsive out of the box. These 115 bytes of css fix the ‘almost’ part.

Things like images and tables can have a set widths that would force a layout wider than a viewport.
