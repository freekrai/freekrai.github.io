> The new MacBook Pro is probably great, and most of the initial skepticism probably won’t age well. But I want to pick on one aspect today.
> 
> Having four USB-C ports is awesome.
> 
> Having _only_ four USB-C ports is going to hurt the versatility requirement of pro gear, because there’s a very real chance that you won’t have the right dongle when you need it.
> 
> This is going to happen _a lot_, because even though USB-C is the future, it’s definitely not the present. We’ve had the standard USB plug (USB-A) in widespread use for 18 years, and it’s going to take a few more years for USB-C to become so ubiquitous that we can get away without USB-A ports most of the time.
> 
> A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — _mostly_ USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.
> 
> Including a port that’s still in _extremely_ widespread use isn’t an admission of failure or holding onto the past — it’s making a pragmatic tradeoff for customers’ real-world needs. I worry when Apple falls on the wrong side of decisions like that, because it’s putting form (and profitability) over function.
