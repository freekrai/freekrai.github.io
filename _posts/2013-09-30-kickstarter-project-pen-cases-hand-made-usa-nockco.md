I haven’t mentioned any Kickstarted projects lately, but Nock Co. is a new startup by [Jeffrey Bruckwicki](http://www.oldfourthtailoring.com/) and [Brad Dowdy](http://penaddict.com/) focused on creating beautiful, functional pen accessories.

Their initial [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637878316/nock-co-pen-cases-hand-made-in-the-usa) features numerous products. Ranging from the The Chimneytop, a mini pop-up case with a single zipper for 6-7 pens to The Brasstown, a zippered roll case for pens, pencils, small tools and more.

All of Nock Co’s items are handcrafted in Georgia, USA out of the highest-quality nylon and other materials. A starting pledge of $15 gets you in the door with the Hightower case shown in the picture above.

In less than an hour after going live, the project already got funded, but as of right now, all backing levels still have spots available.
