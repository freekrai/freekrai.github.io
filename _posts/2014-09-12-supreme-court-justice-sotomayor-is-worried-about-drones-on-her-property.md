> Warning that modern technology could bring us into an Orwellian world, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Thursday said that drones and other advancements have serious privacy implications that Americans need to be talking about and deciding how to keep in check, according to The Wall Street Journal.
> 
> In particular, Sotomayor is reported to have honed in on drones, which don’t simply enable government intrusion — but potentially intrusion by members of the public as well.

And we enter the age of paranoia…

My daughter and I like to fly our Parrot AR Drone on weekends around one of the city’s many open parks, the usual attitude from most people isn’t one of “get that thing the heck out of here” but more “that’s cool”.

One person has even referred to drones in a park as the 21st century version of kite flying but that’s a little extreme.

At the same time, the parrot doesn’t have the range some other drones have (and battery is only about 20 minutes of flight time if we’re lucky), but we’d never think of flying it around a neighbourhood, almost as much for fear of someone picking it up and taking it after it landed somewhere as being a polite drone pilot.
