> Today, I’m proud to start a series of posts that will focus on LESS, the dynamic language that takes your CSS and puts it on steroids. LESS let’s you use variables, mixins, nested rules, and even functions within your CSS. It’s extremely powerful and can dramatically speed up your development. There is a little bit of a learning curve to it, but once you wrap your head around it, you won’t type CSS again without using LESS.

A good starting point for delving into the world of Less, the dynamic language for CSS.
