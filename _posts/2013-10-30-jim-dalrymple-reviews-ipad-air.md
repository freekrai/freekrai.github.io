> It’s very hard to describe how good the iPad Air feels in your hand without actually picking one up. It’s kind of like the first time you saw a Retina display for the first time—shock.
> 
> The other thing you will quickly notice is that while the screen size of the iPad Air is the same as the previous generation, the Air is actually a smaller device. The height is the same, but the width is considerably narrower.
> 
> Apple made the distance between the edge of the screen and edge of the iPad smaller on both sides, accounting for the smaller size. The iPad Air now resembles the iPad mini in that respect.
> 
> This smaller size is great. If you have decent sized hands you can type with two thumbs on the iPad in portrait, something I wasn’t really able to do with the last generation iPad without a lot of stretching. Clearly a full-size iPad is not something you will be thumb typing with all the time1, but it does give you an idea of how much smaller the iPad Air is.
> 
> The iPad Air also comes with Apple’s A7 chip, the fastest chip the company has manufactured to date. Power has never been something I worried about on an iPad and I certainly won’t be worried with this new version.
> 
> The A7 is a 64-bit chip that is packed with power. There aren’t any apps or any situation that I have tried or can think of that would slow down this iPad. In fact, the A7 chip has twice the processing power and graphics performance as the A6X chip found in the iPad 4. That’s an astounding amount of power increase for a single generation.
> 
> The Air is also equipped with the M7 chip, a new coprocessor first introduced on the iPhone 5s. The M7 takes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass and can deliver that information to apps without accessing the A7. This ultimately means power savings for the user because the more power hungry A7 doesn’t have to work at gathering that information.
> 
> Speaking of power—let’s talk about the battery. I don’t use my iPad all day, every day, but I do use it on occasion throughout the day. For instance, if I have an appointment, I’ll take the iPad with me and do some writing. I did that today.
> 
> I sat for a few hours today, utilizing LTE for Internet, and writing in Byword. I was doing simple things really—nothing that was taxing for such a powerful device, but still important work for me.
