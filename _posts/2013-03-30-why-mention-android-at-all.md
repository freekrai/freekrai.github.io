John Sherrod, on Facebook’s “Home on Android” event next week:

> If that’s true, the most fascinating thing to me about this invitation is that it mentions Android at all. Lately the trend has been for companies to develop phones and tablets based on a heavily customized version of Android and not even mention Google’s OS in their press events.

He does have a point.. Almost makes you wonder if they’re actually just going to announce a major new app for Android rather than simply their own device?

Perhaps a new homescreen / launcher replacement?
