> We have some exciting news that we wanted to share with you. Loom is now officially part of Dropbox, and we couldn’t be happier to join forces!
> 
> We’ve been working hard to create a photo management solution for people just like us. People who have too many photos in too many places, taking up space, collecting dust on our phones, our computers and our external hard drives. It’s a big problem and a common one that many have been grinding hard to solve!
> 
> It’s been a long road and we feel that we have come a long way in solving this problem. We are elated to announce the next step in this journey: Loom is becoming a part of the Dropbox family. We look forward to this transition as the next step in creating a home for all of your photos and videos, seamlessly organized, while still keeping them at your fingertips. With [Carousel](http://carousel.com/), Dropbox has created a gallery for your life’s memories. It’s a single home for all your photos and videos, automatically organized and always with you.
