> Customer complaints that replacement batteries for Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Note 7 have been overheating and quickly losing battery power threaten to complicate the South Korean technology giant’s unprecedented recall of its premium smartphone.
> 
> In South Korea, where Samsung began handing out replacement smartphones to consumers this past Monday, the company acknowledged on Friday that some consumers had been complaining about the replacement smartphones, which contain nonremovable replacement batteries.
> 
> In a statement released on Sunday, Samsung said it would delay resuming sales of the Galaxy Note 7 by three days to Oct. 1 in order to “swiftly” complete its recall, citing that some 200,000 consumers in South Korea haven’t yet turned in their old phones.

This is just turning into one giant facepalm for Samsung. They rush to get new replacement phones out, and the end result is that they give people crap batteries, which may be better than exploding batteries but marginally.
