If you enjoy using Tweetbot on your iPhone or iPad, then you can now test out the alpha version of Tweetbot for Mac

> Tweetbot for Mac is finally available! However it may not be quite as you had hoped. Developing for the Mac is no easy task, especially a full-featured Twitter client.
> 
> However, we’ve gotten to a point where while not complete, it is useable.
> 
> We’ve decided to release it as a public alpha to a) motivate us to finish faster, and b) get feedback to help us build the best Mac incarnation of Tweetbot we can make.
> 
> You can love it or hate it, but rest assured it will only get much much better from here.

I’ve played with it this morning, and there are a few issues, but it’s nice to use instead of the outdated twitter app..
