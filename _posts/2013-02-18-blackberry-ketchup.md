Blackberry ketchup is the craze currently and we love it at our house too, so I started working on a recipe that was tasty and got this oneâ€¦

**What you need**

- 2 cups fresh or frozen blackberries
- 1/2 cup cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup water
- 3/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tangerine, zest grated

**How to Make It**

1. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the berries, vinegar, and water to a boil.
2. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain out the seeds and return the liquid to the saucepan.
3. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, salt, cayenne pepper, butter, and grated tangerine rind.
4. Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.
5. Let cool.
