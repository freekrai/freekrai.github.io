CEO of Google, Larry Page, today (May 22, 2012):

> Sanjay Jha, who was responsible for building the company and placing that big bet on Android, has stepped down as CEO. I would like to thank him for his efforts and am tremendously pleased that he will be working to ensure a smooth transition as long-time Googler Dennis Woodside takes over as CEO of Motorola Mobility.

Phil Goldstein on March 1, 2012:

> Andy Rubin, Google’s senior vice president in charge of mobile, said he is aware of the concerns that Google will favor Motorola, but stressed that Google has “literally built a firewall” between the Android team and Motorola.

Something seems a bit off when you read these two quotes.. I guess *“literally”* doesn’t include putting a loyal Googler in charge of their newly acquired company.
