Om Malik reviews the HTC First, the first smartphone to come with Facebook Home:

> My [distaste](http://gigaom.com/2013/04/04/why-facebook-home-bothers-me-it-destroys-any-notion-of-privacy/) for the privacy challenges of Facebook and its apps including the Home is [pretty well documented](http://om.co/2013/04/08/om-vs-home-facebook-home-that-is/). As we move into the connected age and build a quantified society, Facebook’s dark shadow looms over us like a menacing monster. So perhaps that made me an unlikely reviewer of the HTC First, which is the first official phone that comes with Facebook Home, a hybrid app-skin environment for Google Android.

> Since I don’t really review devices like my talented colleague Kevin Tofel, I will restrict myself to things I like and dislike about Facebook Home. And then, I will share my quick impressions of the actual hardware. So here we go – and please don’t treat this as anything more than just my impressions!
