Federico Viticci:

> With iOS 7, Apple profoundly altered the foundations of their mobile operating system’s design and functionality, and I want to believe that iOS 8, likely due later this year, will allow them to keep building towards new heights of user enjoyment, design refinement, and exploration of features suitable for the post-PC era. The transition to iOS 7 hasn’t been perfectly smooth, but, less than two months [away from WWDC](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-wwdc-2014-kicks-off-june-2/ "Apple Announces WWDC 2014: Kicks Off June 2 - MacStories"), there’s clear, promising potential on the horizon: plenty of new iOS low-hanging fruit.

Federico Viticci did a nice job on bringing together some features he would like to see in the next version of iOS.
