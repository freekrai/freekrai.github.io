Nice article for those considering a CMS..

I’m personally not a fan of MODX at all. It’s too messy to work with. Similar to Drupal and Joomla, where if a client needs something done with either of those CMSs I usually turn it down.

I personally find WordPress handy for everything it can do, and it’s easy to turn off something as well..

If a site (or a client) is mostly using custom post types and doesn’t plan to use posts, then I just disable posts from the menu, likewise with other areas as well.

I also like [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) for it’s simplicity and flexibility.

And yes, I have built many of my own CMS systems over the years, but have been leaning to simply using what’s already there for the last little while.
