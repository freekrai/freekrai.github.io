<div class="post" style="color: #222222;"><div class="linked">Google is building a new Silver brand of handsets, which will apparently replace the Nexus phones they currently make.

In my opinion, this is the biggest impact:

> The phones would be designed to extend Google’s recent efforts to control its presence on Android devices more than it has in the past, like the mandatory ‘Powered by Android’ logo on boot screens and the folder of Google-created apps. Silver devices will also get more timely Android updates, like Nexus hardware.

One of the biggest reasons for Silver is taking back control of Android from companies like Samsung:

> In fact, part of the motivation behind Google’s Silver program is said to be winning back more control of Android from Samsung in particular. Reports have long suggested there could be some unease at Google about the amount of influence Samsung has over Android given its dominant global market share.

I’m divided on this, I applaud Google for finally showing some initiative and trying to cut back on some of the customization the companies do to their Android devices, but I’m also pretty certain that this move is sure to extend the fragmentation in the Android market, meaning fewer phones will be running the latest and greatest.
