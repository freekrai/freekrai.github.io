> Samsung unveiled its heavily anticipated Galaxy S4 handset. The event had the hype and production values of an Apple product launch. But, what barely seemed in attendance was any idea that the S4 is an Android phone or contains Google services.
> 
> Much of the product launch was devoted to showcasing software rather than hardware features. Samsung is positioning the phone as a “life companion.” Perhaps most interesting, Google was never mentioned and Android drew one lesser mention in the context of the phone’s “Knox” enterprise security system.
