I used to use Microsoft OneNote years ago, it came on laptops with Windows, and I used it heavily on the two touchscreen Windows laptops I had years ago. I’ve since moved on to [Evernote](http://evernote.com) myself, and otherwise, I use apps for their functions. Things for tasks, Simplenote for notes, Pinboard for bookmarks, Fantastical for scheduling,

But Evernote, I use for recipes, business cards, and a bunch of other notes, it’s handy to go back to now and then..

If you are interested in trying out OneNote though, here’s the link to the [Mac version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote/id784801555?mt=12), and the [iPad version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote-for-ipad/id478105721?mt=8), and the [iPhone version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote-for-iphone/id410395246?mt=8).
