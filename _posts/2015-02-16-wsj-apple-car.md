Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Ramsey, reporting Friday for the WSJ:

> Apple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.
>
> The Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named “Titan,” initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.

The fact that Apple would have a team working on an electric car is really not that hard to believe. 

That such a vehicle “resembles a minivan”, that I find hard to believe.
