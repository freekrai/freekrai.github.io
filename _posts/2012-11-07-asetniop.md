An interesting keyboard concept. They have a web-based tutorial where you can try it out on your iPad, and I totally recommend that you do try it out.

After playing with this on my iPad for 10 minutes, I was feeling pretty confident.

I can really see this gaining some traction, itâ€™s simple, easy, and fast. Seems like it would be ten times easier to teach children.
