> Cocos2d-html5 is written in Javascript for html5 compliant browsers, also licensed in MIT. It can run on ANY platforms provided that it have access to internet and a html5 ready browser. Yes your internet fridge might be able to run Cocos2d-html5!

Cocos2d, the popular game engine for making 2d games for iOS devices has just released an html5 native platform. This is another entry in the growing html5 game engine world. Iâ€™ve been working with IgniteJS lately, but may have to try out Cocos2d-html5 shortly.
