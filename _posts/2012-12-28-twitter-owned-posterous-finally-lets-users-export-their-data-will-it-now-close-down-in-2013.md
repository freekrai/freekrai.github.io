Jon Russell, writing for The Next Web:

> When Posterous was [bought by Twitter in March](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/03/12/twitter-has-acquired-shortform-blogging-company-posterous/), the team behind the blogging platform [said](http://blog.posterous.com/big-news) it would introduce a system to allow users to export their data from the service “in the coming weeks”. Eight months later, the service finally launched a back-up tool, [as announced on its blog](http://blog.posterous.com/posterous-spaces-backup-tool-available-now).
> 
> Initially conceived for those users who feared that Twitter’s ownership would change the platform or see it closed down, [the backup feature](https://posterous.com/#backup) lets users request an email which contains a zip file of all of their posts in HTML format. This significantly helps the process of moving to another host — such as WordPress or Tumblr — although it isn’t a direct porting system which would be easiest.

They make a valid point here, everyone expects Posterous to shut down at some point since being bought by Twitter, and with the new backup feature, it seems the shutdown may be closer…
