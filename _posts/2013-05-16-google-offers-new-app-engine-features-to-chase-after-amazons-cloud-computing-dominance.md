> In the market for cloud infrastructure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates, powering websites and applications like Netflix, Reddit, and Dropbox, and raking in massive revenues — estimated to grow to [$8.8 billion this year](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3847116/why-amazon-stock-record-unstoppable-monster). But there are lots of players, ranging from smaller companies like Rackspace to big ones like Microsoft. One such player is Google, which over the past five years has been working to let developers tap into its massive data center infrastructure, first with App Engine — a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for hosting web apps, and more recently with Compute Engine — a competitor to Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that lets you pay Google to do your heavy computing. Today, Google announced some significant updates to both, [adding PHP support in App Engine](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.jp/2013/05/ushering-in-next-generation-of.html), and [opening up Compute Engine to every developer](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.jp/2013/05/google-compute-engine-is-now-open-to-all.html) that wants to use it. It also announced Google Cloud Storage, which competes with Amazon’s S3 storage solution.
