> This weekend, Microsoft Stores launched a trade-in program to encourage sales of the new Surface Pro 3, but the trade-in promotion named only a single device: the MacBook Air, at a value of “up to $650″ toward any Surface Pro 3 purchase. At the lowest specification, that trade-in amount would let buyers walk out of a Microsoft Store with an Intel i3 Surface Pro 3 for as little as $150.
