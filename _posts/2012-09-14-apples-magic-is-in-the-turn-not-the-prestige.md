MG Siegler writing about people who are “disappointed” that the iPhone 5 looks the same as the iPhone 4S:

> That’s the thing — when people say they’re disappointed about the new iPhone, what they’re really saying is that they’re disappointed it doesn’t look that much different from previous version(s). But again, not only is that true, Apple went out of their way to make sure that was the case.

Nice reading..
