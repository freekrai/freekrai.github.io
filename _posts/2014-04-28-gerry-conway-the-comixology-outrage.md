Gerry Conway:

> And so, as we could have predicted, Amazon wrecks Comixology.
> 
> What has it been, less than a month since Jeff Bezos bought the most promising tool for renewing the mass distribution of comics in the digital era? I’ll give the man this: he’s moved faster to undermine an existing technology for the benefit of his own company than General Motors did when it sabotaged Los Angeles’s public transit Red Line for the benefit of the bus fleet they wanted to sell the City of Angels.
> 
> Job well done, Jeff.

I’ve been a fan of Gerry Conway’s writing since I was a kid and I just couldn’t help sharing this article when I came across it.
