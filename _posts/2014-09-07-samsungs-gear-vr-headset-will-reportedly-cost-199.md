> Samsung’s Gear VR virtual reality headset will cost $199, according to a report from VentureBeat, although that doesn’t include the cost of the Galaxy Note 4, which works as the headset’s screen. The Oculus-powered Gear VR, officially announced Wednesday, is designed to wrap around the Galaxy Note 4. The headset is wireless and powered by the phone.
> 
>  Oculus also said this week that the consumer version of the Rift headset will cost between $200 and $400. On the surface, that sounds like the two headsets are competitively priced, but you have to account for the cost of a Note 4. An official price for that hasn’t been announced, although it’s rumored to be $799, or $299 with a contract.
