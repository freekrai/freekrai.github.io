CNET:

> Meitu is a viral sensation. Who wouldn’t want to instantly give themselves or their favorite politicians and celebs a Japanese-anime inspired makeover, and share the hilarious results with the world? That’s why the face-recognizing photo app is currently rocking the charts.
> 
> But before you zip on over to the App Store or Google Play to grab your free copy, there’s something you should probably know: Meitu is asking for an awful lot of your data in exchange for the lolz — and the app also seems to contain some rather suspicious code.

The app creates some really bad photos, which made me want to stay away from it as it was, but the security implications mean no one should download or use this app ever.
