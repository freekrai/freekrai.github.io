MG Siegler on Jeff Bezos’s Strategy With Amazon:

> The goal is actually to not make a huge profit too early, and [Bezos manages it perfectly](https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/364491625957175297). You want to avoid showing your cards too early as you continue to lay the groundwork for an ever-larger business. Occasionally, you’ll have to show those cards and win a hand to prove that you can. But the rest of the time you call and fold, as you await the monster to take the entire pot.
