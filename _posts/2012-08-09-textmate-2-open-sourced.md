This had been talked about for a few weeks now, and today Macromates announced that TextMate 2 has been open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)..

I tried TextMate when it first came out, but then jumped to Coda and later to Coda 2.. Iâ€™ve also played with Sublime Text 2 and Chocolat, but Coda was always more my editor of choice.

I was looking forward to TextMate 2 though, and used the buggy alpha that was released last year.

I also know several other developers who are die hard fans of TextMate, and with TextMate 2 open sourcing, they take this as a sad day..

I think [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/textmate2-gpl/) said it best:

> As for TextMate 2 and its future , this presents an interesting crossroads for the app. Either it will languish in development and interest and become but a blip in Mac nerd memory, or it will be rapidly worked on with the potential to become the best open sourced text editor for the Mac.
> 
> The latter is probably not likely, but I still irrationally hold out hope that the latter is what occurs.
