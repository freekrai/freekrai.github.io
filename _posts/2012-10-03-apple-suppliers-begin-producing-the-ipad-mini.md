“Two of the people”, Wall Street Journal:

> The smaller tablet will have a 7.85-inch liquid-crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest iPad, which was released in March, two of the people said. The screen on the current iPad measures 9.7 inches diagonally, a size that hasn’t changed since the first model was released in 2010.
