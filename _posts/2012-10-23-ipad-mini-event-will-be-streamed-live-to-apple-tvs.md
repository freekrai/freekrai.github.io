> Apple will stream a live video feed from today’s iPad mini keynote directly to Apple TVs. Users with an Apple TV should see a new “Apple events” icon on their homescreen. Clicking on the icon will take you to a page inviting you to tune in at 10AM Pacific time to watch the event live.
> 
> First noticed by MacRumors, the decision marks a u-turn for Apple, which hasn’t broadcast live video from an event since 2010.

**Update:** BGR is reporting that the stream will be available on all iOS devices. Just [follow this link](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/) in Safari on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch
