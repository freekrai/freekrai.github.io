Amar Toor, for The Verge

> In Skyfall, the Japanese island of Hashima serves as the secret headquarters of Raoul Silva, the well-coiffed Bond villain played by Javier Bardem.
> 
> In reality, it serves as a sobering reminder of the pitfalls of industrialization, and the human toll it can exact.
> 
> Late last month, Messy Nessy Chic published a detailed history of the island, which, at the turn of the 20th century, was a bustling coal-mining town owned by the Mitsubishi Corporation.
> 
> Things took a turn for the sinister at the dawn of World War II, when the Japanese turned the island into a bona fide labor camp for Chinese and Korean prisoners.
> 
> By 1959, the island boasted the highest population density on Earth (139,100 per square kilometer), and living conditions soon deteriorated.
> 
> That changed once Japan turned to petroleum, and today the island is completely abandoned and degraded, as it has been for the last 38 years.
