> Cargo-Bot was developed by Rui Viana using Codea. After creating an initial prototype he spent several months polishing and perfecting his design. The completed Codea project was then imported into the Codea Xcode Template (to be released soon) and published as a native iPad application.

Is this what’s next? Apps being built from the devices they are going to be run on? Could be interesting…
