Since I tend to review a lot of different iPad keyboards, I get asked a lot as to which keyboard is my favourite, which keyboard do I use everyday as my main goto keyboard with my iPad?

Is it the [Logitech Solar Keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/09/14/logitech-solar-keyboard-folio-for-ipad) or the [Logitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/07/09/logitech-tablet-keyboard-for-ipad), or is the [Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/06/12/ultrathin-keyboard-cover) or the [Origami Workstation Keyboard Cover](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/03/31/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2-and-ipad)?

The answer is the Origami with my bluetooth Apple keyboard.

I find it the handiest, mostly due to the fact that it can just be thrown into a messenger bag pretty easily and not take up much room.

There’s also the fact that it doesn’t matter what case the iPad is in for it to work, any case can sit on the Origami nicely.. Plus, you can use the iPad in landscape or portrait mode whereas some of the other keyboards only work with one positioning. The Logitech Tablet Keyboard is the second best in this regard as well.

Plus, you can unhook the keyboard and just use it as a stand for the iPad if you find it more convenient to position it differently.
