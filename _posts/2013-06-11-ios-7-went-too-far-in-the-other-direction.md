Mike Rundle’s initial impressions on iOS 7:

> I expected iOS 7 to be much flatter than iOS 6, but still with subtle curvatures, inset highlights and shadows to indicate subtlety and realism and that the interface was emulating some physical materials. I was very wrong. iOS 7 is as flat as a board.

Mike makes some good points in his post, and I think he’s pretty much in the same area as most people when they first see iOS 7…
