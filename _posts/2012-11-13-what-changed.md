MG Siegler takes a look at what happened at Microsoft and the company’s “no compromise” approach to Windows:

> A day later, all of the stories about the Steven Sinofsky departure seem to be pointing in the same general direction:
> 
> That he was indeed fired (or asked to leave).  
>  That he clashed with Steve Ballmer.  
>  That he didn’t work well with others.  
>  That Ballmer wanted a more collaborative Microsoft.  
>  That Windows 8 and Surface sales had nothing to do with it.  
>  What I’ve heard from people both inside and close to Microsoft is in line with all of those things. But I’m still not sold on the last point.

> Is it too early to gauge the success of Windows 8 and the Surface in the market? Sure. But Microsoft certainly has their own internal metrics and indicators that give them a better sense of how things are going. I’m obviously not privy to such data, but a 23-year veteran of Microsoft, the man in charge of both projects, was just fired.
