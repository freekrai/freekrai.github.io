> [Lots](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/10/16/the-surface-ad-sucks-balls/) of [words](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/10/surface-commercial/) have been written about [Microsoft’s new Surface ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mSckyoAMHg). I think Gruber [said it best](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/17/surface-ad):

The ad has a clear message: Surface is an iPad-size tablet with a magnetic keyboard cover and it’s fun. That’s a pretty good message. It’s about framing the product in people’s minds.

There are some obvious similarities: people are dancing around, enthralled with the product in their hands. Very little information about that product is actually shared, and we really don’t even get a great look at what is being sold.

Some very astute observations from Stephen Hackett. When I saw the Surface ad a few days ago. I had to ask myself what they were trying to market? They show off the keyboard and the kick stand, and a bunch of people running around dancing, but nothing about what you can actually do with the Surface.

Pretty much exactly as Stephen mentioned above, it’s a lot like the old iPod ads, before they had apps to show how useful the device really becomes..
