Official statement from Apple on the “iTunes deleting your music” bug:

> In an extremely small number of cases users have reported that music files saved on their computer were removed without their permission. We’re taking these reports seriously as we know how important music is to our customers and our teams are focused on identifying the cause. 
> 
> We have not been able to reproduce this issue, however, we’re releasing an update to iTunes early next week which includes additional safeguards. If a user experiences this issue they should contact AppleCare.

Huh? They can't reproduce the bug but they can safeguard against it?
