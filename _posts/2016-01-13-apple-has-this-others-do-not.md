Jeffrey Mincey, writing for Mac360:

> A customer can be engaged by a product in many ways, but compare the basic customer experience of buying an Apple product at an Apple Store vs. buying any other product anywhere else, and then compare the customer experience when using the product.

> Have you ever talked to a Google employee? Walk into an Apple Store and you’re likely to be greeted by an Apple associate multiple times before you leave. If not always technically proficient, they are friendly, courteous, and helpful. Google does not have an experience to match.

This is a very big part of the modern Apple experience. 

At its core is the fact that Apple makes the hardware and the software, something Steve Jobs was very insistent about right from the very beginning. 

This gives Apple complete control over the customer experience.
