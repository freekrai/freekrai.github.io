I previously posted a version of this recipe on [FoodJumper](http://foodjumper.com/recipes/sauces-and-spices/the-best-bbq-sauce/) a while back, but I felt like sharing it here as well as I’ve started modifying it again..

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Canola Oil
- 3 medium sized onions
- 1 cup Espresso or Regular Coffee
- 165 millilitres Cola
- Half a Chipotle Pepper
- 1 tablespoon Cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon Ground Mustard Seed
- Pinch of ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons Soy Sauce
- 3 dashes of Worchester Sauce
- 500 millilitres ketchup

### Directions

1. Slice 3 medium sized onions into thin semi-circles.
2. Get a medium sized pot on high heat and add Canola Oil.
3. Once the oil is hot, add the onions. Let them caramelize, stirring occasionally, until they reduce by half and turn a nice brown color. It will take approximately 20 minutes, and be patient – it’ll make all the difference.
4. Once the onions are done, remove them from the heat and add the remaining ingredients: espresso, chipotle pepper, cayenne, cola, ground mustard seed, pepper, soy sauce, Worchester Sauce and ketchup. Mix them all together.
5. Let the sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes on medium heat.
6. I like this sauce nice and chunky, but if you want it to be a bit smoother, feel free to blend it with a hand blender or food processor.
7. Pop it into an airtight container and it will keep in your fridge for a week.
