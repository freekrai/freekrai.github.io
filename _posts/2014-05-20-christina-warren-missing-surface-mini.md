Christina Warren, writing for Mashable:

> Last week, Mashable Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff [urged Microsoft not to release a Surface Mini](http://mashable.com/2014/05/12/microsofts-surface-mini-expectations/) unless it was every bit as good as the iPad mini. Go big (or in this case, “small”) or go home. Good enough doesn’t cut it.
