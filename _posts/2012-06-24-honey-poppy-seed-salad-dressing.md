A classic poppy seed dressing is a nice change from the standard vinaigrette, and this easy version is a snap to make:

Just mix cider vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, poppy seeds, and oil until a tangy-sweet dressing forms.

Itâ€™s great tossed in coleslaw, or try it with chicken fingers for a new twist on honey-mustard dipping sauce.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/3 cup cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil

Instructions
------------

1. Place the vinegar, honey, mustard, poppy seeds, and salt in a large, nonreactive bowl, season with pepper, and whisk to combine.
2. While whisking constantly, slowly add the oil until all of it is incorporated.
3. If not serving immediately, refrigerate the dressing in a container with a tightfitting lid for up to 2 weeks.
