> When Google unveiled the very first Chrome OS laptop, the vision was clear: [Eric Schmidt told us that Chromebooks would be cheap, disposable products](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/20/schmidt-says-chrome-os-devices-will-be-disposable-priced-like/) that you could easily replace at will. Today, however, the company’s taking a different tack. This is the Chromebook Pixel, the first Chromebook designed by Google itself, and it’s unmistakably a premium product. It also just so happens to aiming directly at Apple’s MacBook Pro with Retina Display.

> Like Apple’s notebook, the highlight is the Gorilla Glass-covered screen: with a 12.85-inch, 2560 x 1700 touchscreen panel, Google says it’s the highest resolution display that’s ever shipped on a laptop. “You’ll never ever see another pixel in your life,” says Chrome VP Sundar Pichai. And yet this particular screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio: In order to better fit web content, which often flows vertically down a page, the screen is nearly as tall as it is wide.

This could be interesting.. Google finally making their own Chromebooks.. But.. not sure how well Chromebooks would compete with MacBooks overall..
