Marco Arment:

> My criteria for this review is what someone seeking good headphones today probably wants:
> 
> Semi-portable, over-ear headphones — not pocketable, but should fit comfortably in a small bag; suitable for listening at your desk and bringing on an airplane, or maybe wearing outside
> 
> Closed-back design with at least moderate isolation
> 
> A straight, short cable with a 3-button clicker
> 
> The hard price cap is $400, but ideally, these should be under $300.

I’ve been thinking about new studio headphones so Marco’s review was interesting for the variety he tested if nothing else.
