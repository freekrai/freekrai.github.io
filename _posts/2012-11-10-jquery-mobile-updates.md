> Not too long ago, the jQuery team released jQuery Mobile 1.2. This new release has some fantastic changes! In this article, we’re going to review some of the new widgets available to developers, take a look at changes made to existing widgets, and glance over a few impactful enhancements that could affect your jQuery Mobile application.

> Let’s get started, shall we? Firstly, we’ll need to download the bits and bytes. Head over to the jQuery Mobile download page and download the option that best meets your needs. Alternately you can just use the boilerplate code provided below.
> 
> Additionally, now might be a good time to quickly discuss the Download Builder that the jQuery Mobile team is building. It’s still in Alpha, but it allows you to customize your download to include only the parts of jQuery Mobile that you require, and nothing more. You can exclude specific events, transitions, form elements, or widgets that you don’t care about. It’s meant for the developers who are ultra-concerned with grasping the highest level of performance out of his or her application.
