With the release of iOS 4, the Core Location framework received a significant update by providing support for geofencing. Not only can an application be notified when the device enters or exits a geofence, the operating system also notifies when the application is in the background. This addition to the Core Location framework fits neatly in Appleâ€™s endeavor to support multitasking on iOS. This opens up a number of possibilities, such as performing tasks in the background through geofencing and that is exactly what this tutorial is about.
