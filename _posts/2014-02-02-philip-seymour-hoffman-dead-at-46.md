> [*The Wall Street Journal* reports](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304626804579358943360702878) that renowned actor Philip Seymour Hoffman was today found dead in his New York City apartment. Although neither the NYPD nor the coroner’s office has publicly given a reason for the 46-year-old actor’s death, [*The New York Times*cites an anonymous officer](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/movies/philip-seymour-hoffman-actor-dies-at-46.html) as stating it was drug related.
> 
> [Reports from the scene](http://nypost.com/2014/02/02/philip-seymour-hoffman-found-dead-in-his-apartment/) allege that Hoffman was found in his bathroom with a hypodermic needle in his arm, suggesting the actor’s death was the result of an accidental overdose. Hoffman had already struggled with drug-related issues in recent years. [*TMZ* reported last May](http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/30/philip-seymour-hoffman-detox-narcotics-heroin-drugs-abuse/) that the actor had checked himself into rehab for prescription pill and heroin abuse after “falling off the wagon” in 2012.

Hoffman was an talented actor, stuff like this is always sad…
