Over the weekend, I set up a new twitter handle [@rogerstringer_](http://twitter.com/rogerstringer_), this handle is to handle all blog posts I make, whereas my personal handle [@freekrai](http://twitter.com/freekrai) remains as it always was.

Reasons for this? Well one, so that my blog posts don’t take over my regular twitter posts. I’ll still retweet important enough posts through my other handle, but this way, it’s a little cleaner. :)
