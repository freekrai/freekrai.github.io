Amar Toor, for The Verge

> Earlier this week, a fan site published an [early draft](http://www.prometheus-movie.com/uploads/112142280-Alien-Engineers.pdf) of a script for *Prometheus*, revealing plot points and alien creatures that never appeared in Ridley Scott’s final version.
> 
> Titled *Alien: Engineers*, the script was penned by Jon Spaihts before *Lost *creator [Damon Lindelof](http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3030928/damon-lindelof-on-prometheus-on-the-verge) eventually took over, and includes new plot twists involving alien parasites and even Facehuggers.

I actually saved this to draft earlier this week, but waited to post it til I took time to read it.. And it’s actually a better movie than what we got.. Not complaining too much, I actually liked Prometheus, but.. This could have been better.
