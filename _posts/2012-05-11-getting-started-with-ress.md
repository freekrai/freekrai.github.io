> I know that our industry doesn’t need another acronym, but here is one more for you: RESS. RESS stands for “Responsive Design + Server Side components” and it is Luke Wroblewski that is guilty of making you learn yet another term. He didn’t invent something new when he wrote an article about it back in September, but he put a name to something that many used to call a ‘hybrid’ solution before.

RESS is an interesting approach to Responsive Design, that incorporates responsive design with server-side components. I’ve run into a few projects where this has been necessary, so nice to see others working on a solution as well.
