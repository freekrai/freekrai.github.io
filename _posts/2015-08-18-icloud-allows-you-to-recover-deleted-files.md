> Apple has introduced a new feature for iCloud on the web that allows you to restore deleted items. Not only can you recover files that youâ€™ve deleted, but also restore contacts, calendars, and reminders.
>
> This new feature also shows you how long it will be until those items are permanently deleted if you choose not to restore them.

Great feature.
