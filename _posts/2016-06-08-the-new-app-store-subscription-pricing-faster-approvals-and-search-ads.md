John Gruber: 

> “We’re doing something a little different this year. We’ve got a bunch of App Store/developer-related announcements for WWDC next week, but frankly, we’ve got a busy enough keynote that we decided we’re not going to cover those in the keynote. And rather, just cover them in the afternoon and throughout the week. We’re talking to people today for news tomorrow about those things, in advance of WWDC, and then developers can come and be ready for sessions about these things, with knowledge about them before the conference. We haven’t done this before, but we figured, what the heck, let’s give it a try.”

This is an entirely new business model for app developers — one that I think will make indie app development far more sustainable.

Looks like there are some interesting app stores changes coming up shortly... The subscription-based pricing is especially interesting.
