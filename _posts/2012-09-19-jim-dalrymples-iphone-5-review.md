Great overall review of the new iPhone by Jim Dalrymple:

> I am able to easily navigate through the iPhone 5 menus and options using one hand. My thumb reaches the top of the screen to tap on options and hit the back button without shuffling the phone in my hand.
> 
> This is a mobile device, not a desktop computer. We want to operate an iPhone with one hand. This is a device that we use on the go, with a coffee in one hand and an iPhone in the other. We can send an email, visit a Web page or make a phone call.
> 
> We can also use the multitude of apps available, but the second you require two-hands, you take away functionality and convenience from the user. That is a design failure.
