[Craig Hockenberry](http://furbo.org/2016/11/05/apples-lenovo/) has another take on what Apple should do with the Mac Pro:

> Licensing just the operating system was a disaster for Apple. Professional customers don’t have the time to build and maintain their own Hackintoshes. Any partnership to build Mac hardware would need to be structured so that it benefits Apple, the partner, and customer alike.
> 
> Just like IBM and their clients have benefitted from Lenovo.
