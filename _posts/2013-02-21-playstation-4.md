When Sony introduced the PlayStation 3, they showed off a device that looked nicer and had more power than the actual PlayStation 3 did when it was relased.

Now, instead of being embarrassed that way again, Sony decides to hold a press event for a device that they instead don’t show at all, and then won’t give a shipping date or price for?
