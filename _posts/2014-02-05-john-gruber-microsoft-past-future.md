John gives an interesting look at Microsoft’s past and where they are heading in relation to yesterday’s appointing of Satya Nadella as the new CEO.

Microsoft has been doing well with their Azure services, and Nadella’s background running that area just might be what Microsoft needs.

Further down in John’s post, he also mentioned this:

And I have to agree, Microsoft’s Azure service has been more successful of late than their desktop services, and are where they need to focus more on now.
