John Paczkowski:

> A stumbling miss that includes a $900 million charge thanks to Surface RT inventory adjustments. That write-down, which is evidently driven by the Surface RT price reduction Microsoft announced earlier this week is worth $0.07 per share. Accounting for that, earnings per share are 66 cents, which is still far below expectations.
> 
> Bad news, for which Microsoft is already paying dearly. The companyâ€™s shares are trading down 4 percent as I write this.
