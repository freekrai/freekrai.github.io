Fraser Speirs details his workflow for producing episodes of [Out of School](http://outofschool.net/) without a Mac:

> When I told some friends that I was “podcasting” on iOS, they assumed that all I was doing was recording myself on iOS and doing the post-production later on a Mac. Not so! In fact, we actually do the entire end-to-end audio production purely on iOS.

The fact that several episodes have been created using an iPhone and iPad with a portable podcasting setup is pretty neat, and showcases even more of what you can do with these handy devices…
