> We all know the “four horsemen” of tech: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. These are the companies that pretty much everyone agrees will shape the foreseeable future of the tech sector. In some circles, that list makes waves for who is not included: Microsoft. But any rational thinker (meaning those outside of Redmond or anyone who hasn’t made a career as a .Net developer) knows that Microsoft simply no longer belongs on that list.

Interesting points on why Samsung should be the fifth horseman. Samsung is a huge company, but one question remains: can Samsung predict what consumes will want before they know they want it?

The ability to answer that question is one of Apple’s greatest strengths. Apple is constantly working on products we don’t even know we’ll want yet, but when they’re released, we have to have them right away.
