Before Facebook bought Oculus VR yesterday, <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Minecraft was exploring a deal to bring a version of the incredibly popular gaming environment to Oculus. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">But once the Facebook deal was announced, Markus Persson, also known as Notch,</span>[tweeted this](https://twitter.com/notch/statuses/448586381565390848)<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">:</span>

> We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.

He then followed up with a blog post that went into more detail.

> Of course, they wanted Minecraft. I said that it doesn’t really fit the platform, since it’s very motion based, runs on java (that has a hard time delivering rock solid 90 fps, especially since the players build their own potentially hugely complex levels), and relies a lot on GUI. But perhaps it would be cool to do a slimmed down version of Minecraft for the Oculus. Something free, similar to the Minecraft PI Edition, perhaps? So I suggested that, and our people started talking to their people to see if something could be done.

> And then, not two weeks later, Facebook buys them.

> Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build.

> Don’t get me wrong, VR is not bad for social. In fact, I think social could become one of the biggest applications of VR. Being able to sit in a virtual living room and see your friend’s avatar? Business meetings? Virtual cinemas where you feel like you’re actually watching the movie with your friend who is seven time zones away?
