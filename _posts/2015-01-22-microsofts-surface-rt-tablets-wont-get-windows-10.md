> Microsoft unveiled its plans for a free copy of Windows 10 for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users yesterday, but it looks like Windows RT is being left out in the cold.
> 
>  In a statement provided to The Verge, Microsoft confirms the Surface Pro 3 and “entire Surface Pro lineup” will get the update to Windows 10, but Windows RT won’t get the full OS. “We are working on an update for Surface, which will have some of the functionality of Windows 10. More information to come,” says a Microsoft spokesperson.
> 
>  This means tablets like the Surface RT and Surface 2 won’t get Windows 10.

This doesn’t come as a surprise, Just like when the Surface Pro 3 came out and the RT didn’t receive any updates, I can see the RT slowly dying a slow death with one final major update.
