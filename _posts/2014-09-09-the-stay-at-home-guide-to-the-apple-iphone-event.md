> Tomorrow is a big day for Apple. They are taking the stage at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino and going to take the wraps off of the iPhone 6. Moreover, there are also rumors of an iWatch, secure payment, and other bits and bobs.
> 
> There is even a secret building. For Apple geeks, it is the Super Bowl, Oscars, and Christmas morning all wrapped up into one. Even with the larger venue, there are a lot of us that won’t be able to attend so I thought it would be fun to have my own stay-at-home guide for those of us that didn’t get a golden ticket.

Good advice on how to watch today’s Apple event.
