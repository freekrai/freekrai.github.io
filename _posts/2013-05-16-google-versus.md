Being negative isn’t how we make progress. Most important things are not zero sum, there is a lot of opportunity out there.

But Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are now just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better. Think about even web search: Google search wasn’t something new; it was something better. Way, way, way better, but still.

Great post by John Gruber on Larry Page’s attempt to change the conversation whenever Google rips something off or crushes a market.
