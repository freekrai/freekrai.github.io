Daniel Jalkut:

> As the sheer number of Apple developers increases, the capacity of WWDC remains the same. The goals of the conference both for Apple and for developers are increasingly unmet as the number of developers who would like to be educated, indoctrinated, and communed with far outweighs the number of developers who actually can be.

I donâ€™t ending WWDC is the right approach, I think maybe something like the lottery mentioned earlier is needed.. Or something else..
