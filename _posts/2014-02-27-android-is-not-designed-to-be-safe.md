Sundar Pichai, speaking at Mobile World Congress:

> We cannot guarantee that Android is designed to be safe, the format was designed to give more freedom. When people talk about 90% of malware for Android, they must of course take into account the fact that it is the most popular operating system in the world. If I had a company dedicated to malware, I would also be addressing my attacks on Android.

Inspiringâ€¦ Really makes me want to use Android
