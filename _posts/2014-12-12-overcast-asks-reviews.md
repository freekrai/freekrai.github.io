Marco Arment:

> My strategy to get good App Store reviews is simple:
> 
> 1. **Make an app good enough for some people to love it.** By nature, you’ll lose some people along the way, but that’s OK: an app that strives to satisfy as many people as possible will usually only get people to kinda like it, not love it.
> 2. **Accumulate a huge surplus of goodwill from those customers** with a combination of step 1, usefulness, delight, and adding more functionality over time.
> 3. **Make it easy to rate the app** with a button that’s never annoying or in the way, like in the Settings screen.
