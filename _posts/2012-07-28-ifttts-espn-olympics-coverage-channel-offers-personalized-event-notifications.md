> Last month, IFTTT brought its web 2.0 automation service to the home with its integration with Belkin’s WeMo range, and now it’s planning to offer personalized scripts that provide the latest coverage of the 2012 London Olympics.
> 
> Dubbed the ESPN Olympics coverage channel, it can be “triggered” by real-time events like the winning of an Olympic medal, a world record is set, or when a story matches a custom search query. From there, you can tell IFTTT what to with that information, like send updates to Pocket or tweet major stories on your behalf.
> 
> There are an abundance of filters that you can use to customize the content to your liking, and you can take a peek at some of the channel’s pre-made recipes here.
