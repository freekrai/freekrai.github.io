> They heavily penalize your ideal audience, people that use real random password generators. Hey guess what, that password randomly didn't have a number or symbol in it. I just double checked my math textbook, and yep, it's possible. I'm pretty sure.

> They frustrate average users, who then become uncooperative and use "creative" workarounds that make their passwords less secure.

> They are often wrong, in the sense that the rules chosen are grossly incomplete and/or insane, per the many shaming links I've shared above.

> Seriously, for the love of God, stop with this arbitrary password rule nonsense already. If you won't take my word for it, read [this 2016 NIST password rules recommendation](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/). It's right there, "no composition rules". However, I do see one error, it should have said "no bullshit composition rules".
