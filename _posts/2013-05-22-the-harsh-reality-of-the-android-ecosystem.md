Om Malik:

> HTC was the shining star during the early days of Android. Now it is reeling under the pressure of cheap Androids, a dominant Samsung and a management disarray. It’s a damn shame, as the new HTC One is actually a nice device.

The One is a nice device. I’ve played with it a few times as I have some friends who have them, and I honestly thought it would do better than it has been.
