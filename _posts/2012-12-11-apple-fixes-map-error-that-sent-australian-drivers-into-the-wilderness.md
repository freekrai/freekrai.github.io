John Paczkowski, for AllThingsD:

> Mildura, Australia, is back in its proper location following an update to Apple’s new iOS Maps application. On Monday, the company corrected an error that placed the town of Mildura in the middle of Murray-Sunset National Park, about 43 miles from its actual location. The mistake led to the stranding of a few motorists, and inspired the Victoria police to issue a bulletin describing it as “potentially life-threatening” and warning against using iPhones to navigate the area.
