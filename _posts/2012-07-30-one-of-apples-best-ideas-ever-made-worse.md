> The MagSafe 2 connector fails that balance test. Badly. The magnet is too weak. It’s so weak, it keeps falling out. It falls out if you brush it. It falls out if you tip the laptop slightly. It falls out if you look at it funny. It’s a huge, huge pain.

David Pogue really doesn’t like the new MagSafe 2 connector. Neither do I..

During its unveiling on the Retina MacBook Pro at WWDC, Phil Schiller simply said, “MagSafe 2 — we took MagSafe and we had to make it even thinner to fit into a design like this.” If it was significantly better in other ways, he probably would have given it a bit more of an explanation.

I’ve always liked the MagSafe connector, but on my Macbook Air, the MagSafe 2 is longer, winder, weaker, uglier, and not as convenient as the previous “L” shape every MagSafe plug has had for the last couple of years.

It’s pretty annoying when this handy magnetic adapter just randomly pops off your Macbook.
