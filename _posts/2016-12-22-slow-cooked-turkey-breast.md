It's christmas, and one favourite christmas dish is turkey.

### What you need

- 2 kg / 4 lb turkey breast, skin on, bone in or boneless (if using frozen, thaw it) (Note 1)
- 1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally
- 1 onion (brown, yellow or white), unpeeled, cut in half
- 5 sprigs of thyme (or 2 tsp dried thyme leaves)
- **Rub**
  - 1.5 tsp garlic powder
  - 1.5 tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 2 tsp salt
  - 5 grinds of black pepper
  - 1.5 - 2 tbsp olive oil
- **Gravy**
  - Chicken broth, for topping up liquid
  - 4 tbsp butter
  - 1/4 cup flour
  - Salt and pepper
  - Savoury


### How to make it

1. Place Rub ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine, it should be a wet paste.
2. Pat the turkey dry all over with paper towels.
3. Cover turkey with the Rub, using most for the side and top.
4. Place the garlic, onion and thyme in the slow cooker.
5. Place the turkey breast on top so it is elevated.
6. Cook on low for 6-7 hours.
7. Remove turkey from the slow cooker and let it rest for 20 minutes before crisping the skin.

#### Gravy

1. Strain the liquid into a measuring cup, top up with chicken broth.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
3. Add flour and mix to combine. Pour about 1/2 cup of liquid into the flour mixture and mix until it forms a paste.
3. Slowly add remaining liquid, stirring as your go.
4. Use a whisk if required to make the gravy smooth.
5. Simmer until thickened - take it off before it is as thick as you want because it will continue to thicken.
6. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with turkey.

#### Crisp the Skin
