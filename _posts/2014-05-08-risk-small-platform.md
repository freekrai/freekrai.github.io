Manton Reese:

> [Marco Arment responds](http://www.marco.org/2014/05/07/manton-adn-api) to my comment that developers should have seen the potential of the App.net API as something much bigger than Twitter. I wanted [my post](http://www.manton.org/2014/05/appnet_niche.html) to be short, but Marco makes good points that are worth following up on. He writes:

App.net never offered either. They started out facing the typical social-network chicken-and-egg problem, put a huge paywall in front to prevent any growth, and tried to alleviate that by adding more chicken-and-egg problems to their offerings.”

> Building entirely on App.net for [Sunlit](http://sunlit.io/) was indeed a huge risk, and one that we expected would take time to pay off. It was a bet on the future. We are incredibly proud of our app and the response it got in the App.net community, but our goal was always to make an app [that appealed to everyone](http://manton.org/2014/01/no_coincidence.html), not just a small niche of tech folks. We’ve actually been working for over a month on a new version of Sunlit that expands the reach of the app beyond App.net, and coincidentally it just went into review at Apple this week.

The main issue with iOS apps is that they couldn’t sign up a new user directly in the app. This made sense when App.net was a paid-only service, because you’d run into in-app purchase issues with Apple, but it became more technically feasible when the free tier launched.
