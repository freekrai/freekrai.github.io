Jeff Benjamin, 9to5Mac:

> In a previous article, posted shortly after Nvidia announced its new Pascal Mac drivers, I briefly discussed my plans to build a new Hackintosh. I’ve been planning and working on the machine for over a week, and I’m finally at the point where I can share the results of my journey.
> 
> This isn’t my first Hackintosh build, but it’s the first build where I decided to go about it without the assistance of the excellent tools over at [tonymacx86](https://www.tonymacx86.com/). I’ve been long interested in building a Hackintosh using just the Clover EFI Bootloader, and that’s exactly what I did for this build.
> 
> Going about it this way allowed me to learn more about the process, and helped me to see that the entire premise, while tedious at times, is actually fairly straightforward. In this initial post, I’ll talk about some of my reasoning behind my hardware choices, and share some initial experiences and benchmark results.

It's been a few years since I've built my own Hackintosh, but if you were interested in building one then I recommend you start with [tonymacx86](https://www.tonymacx86.com/).

But if you want to try without using tonymacx86, then Jeff's article is a nice way to get started.
