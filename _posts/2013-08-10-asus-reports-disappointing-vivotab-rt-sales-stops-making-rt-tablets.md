> In a move that’s likely to surprise…well, just about no one, the Wall Street Journal reports that ASUS will cease making Windows RT tablets. Windows RT is basically stuck in limbo between full Windows 8 (and 8.1) laptops and hybrid devices on the high-end and Android tablets on the low-end, and the market appears to be giving a clear thumbs down to the platform. Many critics have also noted the lack of compelling applications to compete with Android and iOS platforms, which is something we noted in our review of the VivoTab RT last year.

I’ve mentioned the [ASUS VivoTab Smart](http://rogerstringer.com/2013/02/08/asus-vivotab-smart-windows-8-tablet/ "Asus VivoTab Smart Windows 8 Tablet") tablet on here before, I found the non-RT VivoTab to be a nice Windows 8 tablet.. The failure of RT isn’t any surprise for anyone..
