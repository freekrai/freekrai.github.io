> There’s a lot of smoke now billowing around the “7-inch iPad”. This report is hardly the first, nor will it be the last. My only question is the timing.

[Marco Arment:](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/04/the-ipad-mini)

> If Apple were to launch a $200–300 7.8” iPad, they’d probably sell a ton of them for the holiday season — which means they’d need to start ramping up production pretty soon, if not already. If they were doing that, we’d probably see legitimate-looking parts leaked from the supply chain by now, but as far as I know, we haven’t.
> 
> It’s unlikely that Apple would be able to manufacture millions of iPad Minis without someone leaking some parts a few months ahead of their release. So if we don’t see such leaks by September, I don’t think this product, if it exists, will be released this year.

On the heels of last week’s Google Nexus 7 announcement, we’re back to seeing more rumours of Apple possibly bringing out a 7 inch iPad in the fall.

I have to agree with Marco on this, we usually start seeing leaks on new Apple products within a few months of beling released, and so far, nothing…

The news sites are full of pics of the proposed upcoming iPhone 5 that will be released around the same time, but not one picture of a 7 inch iPad, which kind of says that it won’t be coming this year..

Although we could all be wrong, and then we’d have to eat our words, but wouldn’t be the first time..
