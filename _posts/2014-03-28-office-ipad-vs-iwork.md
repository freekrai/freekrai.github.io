Jim Dalrymple:

> It’s important to recognize that Microsoft did a pretty good job in designing Office for iPad. It’s certainly better than what they did for the Surface. Having said that, I don’t find that I’m very excited by Office on the iPad.
> 
> Two of the biggest reasons people are excited about a product is that it solves a problem or that it’s entertaining. Office (and iWork for that matter) is a productivity suite, so it’s not very entertaining by its very nature. I’d argue that at this point, Office doesn’t really solve a problem either.  
>  Microsoft is about four years late in solving a problem for users. The suite of apps should have been released near the introduction of the original iPad in order for it to have a full impact. Unfortunately, the delay gave—or forced—users to find an alternative. And they did—iWork.

> […]
> 
> The challenge for Apple, if it wants to attract more large business users, is to make iWork more robust.
> 
> Honestly, I think the company can do that fairly easily if it puts the engineering teams to work on it, but I don’t think it’s a big priority for them.
> 
> The challenge for Microsoft is to make Office for iPad accessible to more users. That would mean cutting out the $99 subscription price, or at least making it more attractive. I can’t see Microsoft doing that.
> 
> I have no plans to buy a subscription to use Office for iPad, simply because I don’t have to. iWork suits my needs perfectly and I’ve been running my business successfully for years using the apps. I have no reason to change.
> 
> Solve a problem or be entertaining. Office for iPad does neither for me.

I have to use Word for one purpose, and that is that chapters I submit to my publisher need to be formatted in Word template before submission, otherwise, I’d be happy with just iWork or even Google Drive.

I played with Word as well, I even have an Office 365 subscription thanks to my bizspark.com account, but I like Pages and Google Drive, so the usefulness of Office is kind of questionable right now.
