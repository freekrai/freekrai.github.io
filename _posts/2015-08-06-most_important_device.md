John Gruber:

> On Twitter, [Benedict Evans points to fascinating polling data](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/629157862732738564) indicating that the answers to this question are changing dramatically. In 2013, just two years ago, the results were:
> 
> - Laptop 46%
> - Desktop 28%
> - Smartphone 15%
> - Tablet 8%
> 
> In 2015, the results were:
> 
> - Smartphone 33%
> - Laptop 30%
> - Tablet 19%
> - Desktop 14%
> 
> Assuming the polling is valid, this suggests weâ€™ve already passed the inflection point where most people consider their mobile devices (phone and tablet) central to their use of the internet.

John Gruber looking at which devices are important to us. 

If I actually stopped to think about it, I'm pretty sure my answers would be close to the 2015 survey results.
