> When a company promises two years of free mobile data service with a device, you expect them to deliver. So what happens when a promise suddenly evaporates after you’ve purchased a product?

>  That’s the situation owners of Google’s LTE Chromebook Pixel are finding themselves facing right now. The LTE model of the Pixel went on sale from Google’s Play Store last April for $1450. At the time, the product was advertised as coming with a free two-year mobile broadband plan from Verizon — 100 MB per month, with the option to purchase more data on a pay-as-you-go basis as needed.

>  Fast-forward to one year later, and Pixel LTE owners are discovering their data plans have been disconnected. The option to pay for data remains, but the free 100 MB per month mysteriously vanished just one year into the promised two-year period.

The fact that this story is only now breaking in June, two months after it started affecting Chromebook Pixel seems to be telling regarding how popular the Pixel is.

I like Chromebooks, my daughter has one, but the Pixel has never seemed like a main device for me, one of the bigger things about the Chromebooks has always been the lower price point, which the Pixel is far from.
