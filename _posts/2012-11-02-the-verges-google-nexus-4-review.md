Joshua Topolsky , for The Verge

> Getting the Nexus 4 for review was something of a treat for me. I’ve been anticipating the arrival of a follow-up (and upgrade) from the company’s previous flagship device — the Galaxy Nexus — for a handful of very specific reasons. In fact, I’ve held off on moving to other, excellent devices with expectations of this mystery phone in mind. While I have been largely pleased with using the Samsung-produced Nexus, there are some irksome qualities to the handset (a poor camera, weak display, and lack of LTE for AT&T) that have made me eager to switch.

Kudos to Josh on the review, especially for calling out the lack of LTE.
