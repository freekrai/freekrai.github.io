> These days, everyone is jumping on the responsive bandwagon. Apart from responsive layouts, everything is going responsive: sliders, lightboxes, galleries, you name it! But then one day, when I was working on an HTML table with a lot of columns, I thought “How is this going to look on my iPhone?”.

Interesting new jQuery plugin for creating responsive tables..
