iOS 7 is only on the first beta, one important rule is generally not to upgrade your devices to the first beta of any new iOS version unless you can help it, for example, if you are a developer. And even then, it should only be on a device that’s not your main day to day device..

Apple has a mountain of work ahead to get iOS 7 ready for actual release this fall, presumably, in line with the release of new iPhone and iPad devices).

But to judge iOS 7 beta 1 as you would a release version is silly. In fact, until you get to beta 3 or 4, it would be silly to judge iOS 7.
