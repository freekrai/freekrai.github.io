Martin Bekkelund on his friend’s apparent ban from Amazon for no reason:

> Did she violate any terms? Amazon will not tell. Perhaps by accident? Amazon does not care. The conclusion so far is clear: Amazon closed her account, wiped her Kindle and refuses to tell her why. End of discussion.

Amazon uses some really painful corporate language in their responses.. It makes Twitter’s recent blog posts look normal by comparsion.

I’m going to take a guess that Amazon won’t refund the full purchase price of all of the Kindle books she “bought” that Amazon now has stolen back from her, or the Kindle itself that she’s no longer allowed to use.
