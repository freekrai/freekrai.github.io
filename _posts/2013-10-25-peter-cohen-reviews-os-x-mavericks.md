> Over the course of the past decade, we’ve seen many changes to OS X – some iterative, some significant. OS X’s newest incarnation, “Mavericks” or version 10.9, is a bit of both. It doesn’t significantly rework the user interface like Apple did with iOS 7, though there are some nice tweaks. Apple did make a number of changes under the hood to improve performance and efficiency, however, especially for mobile users.
