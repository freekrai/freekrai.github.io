> A woman in Halifax sent a letter to her MP after the U.S. election, hoping it would give her concerns more weight than a tweet or an email, but it keeps getting sent back to her.
> 
> "My letter was addressed to Andy Fillmore, member of Parliament, House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A6," Becca Babcock told CBC's Mainstreet.
> 
> The address isn't the problem, but the envelope is — it has no stamp.
> 
> The thing is, it doesn't need one.
> 
> Babcock wrote the letter to express her commitment to electoral reform and her worries about racism and misogyny.
