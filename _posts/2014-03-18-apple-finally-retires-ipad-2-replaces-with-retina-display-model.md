In a move that people have expected for a while, Apple has finally retired the iPad 2 and re-released the fourth-generation iPad as its replacement.

The fourth-generation iPad is priced at $399 —the same price as the iPad Mini with Retina Display, and $100 less than the iPad Air — and is only available with 16GB of storage.

The decision to replace the iPad 2 with the iPad 4 means that all of Apple’s iPads are now using the company’s Lightning connector and also makes the iPad Mini the only tablet from Apple not to feature a Retina Display.
