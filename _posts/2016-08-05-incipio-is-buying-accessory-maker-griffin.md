> Incipio keeps on buying up big tech accessory brands. The latest is Griffin Technology, an acquisition that Incipio announced today without disclosing terms of the deal. The purchase gives Incipio an even bigger reach into the smartphone case and accessories market — an area where it's already a big name.

> It's not the most exciting pairing, but you can see where it makes sense for Incipio from an efficiency standpoint. Incipio's CEO and founder, Andy Fathollahi, explains the reasoning in a statement: 
> 
> > "As part of Incipio Group, Griffin strengthens our product development and manufacturing capabilities, complements our existing product lines in rugged cases, power and connectivity, and allows our brands to reach a broader domestic and international audience through enhanced distribution in the business-to-business, enterprise, and education verticals."

Incipio and Griffin merging into one company may not be big news, but it is interesting news as these two are two of the major accessory makers for smart phones, tablets and laptops.
