Dan Nosowitz on the Nexus 7:

> The Nexus 7 is the best of its breed, but it also doesn?t give me any evidence that the breed is one that really holds all that much promise. Aside from reading books, I think it?s pretty clear that a 7-inch tablet is not preferable to a larger one like the iPad or [the upcoming Microsoft Surface](http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2012-06/microsoft-announces-its-first-real-tablet-surface). It’s like comparing a moped to a car. Both get you from point A to point B, and it’s not bad for what it is, but they’re not really at the same level as far as capabilities go.
