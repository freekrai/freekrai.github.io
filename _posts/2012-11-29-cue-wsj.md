> The ascent solidifies Mr. Cue’s role as one of the chief deputies  
>  to Mr. Cook, who has surrounded himself with several close  
>  advisers without elevating one to a clear number two. Mr. Cue has  
>  the loyalty and admiration of many longtime employees, who respect  
>  that he was with Apple during the dark days before Mr. Jobs began  
>  his turnaround of the company in the late 1990s.
> 
> Mr. Cue is also a champion of the Apple way: Entering new areas  
>  patiently and slowly and preaching the need to put the customer  
>  first. To negotiating partners, he epitomizes the company’s  
>  penchant for secrecy with a poker face that media companies  
>  scramble to decipher.

> Mr. Cue couldn’t be reached for comment and Apple didn’t make him  
>  available for an interview.
