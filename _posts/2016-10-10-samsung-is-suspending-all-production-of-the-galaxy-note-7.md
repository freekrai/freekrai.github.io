After a [batch of replacement Note 7 phones](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/9/13219878/samsung-galaxy-note-7-replacement-fire-fifth-statement) have caught fire, and combined with Samsung's carrier partners announcing they would stop selling the Note 7 entirely, Samsung is finally [suspending production](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2016/10/10/33/0502000000AEN20161010004100320F.html) of the Galaxy Note 7. 

My question is this.... Why did it take so long to finally stop production of this phone? Reports came in back in August about the Note 7 catching fire, and after doing a round of replacement phones (that ended up having the same issue and even sending at least one person to the hospital), they now decide to just halt the line entirely? Samsung should have thrown in the towel on the Note 7 the first time it started catching fire.
