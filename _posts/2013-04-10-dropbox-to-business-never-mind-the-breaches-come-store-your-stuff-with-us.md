Mark Hachman:

> Dropbox is making a new push to win over business customers to its cloud-storage business. But its checkered history of security breaches may make it a tough sell in the enterprise.
> 
> Dropbox said Wednesday that it has added single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to its storage service, matching a capability that its chief rival, Box.net, has offered for some time. Dropbox also decided to rename its “Dropbox for Teams” business service “Dropbox for Business.” The added feature and a name change may not seem like much to hang the new marketing push on, but Dropbox claims it has high hopes.
> 
> Beginning next month, Dropbox users will be able to sign on to their corporate account using Active Directory, which, behind the scenes, will also log them into Dropbox. The company said it’s partnering with Ping Identity, Okta, OneLogin, Centrify, and Symplified; Ping Identity and Okta also provide SSO solutions to Box, which signed up with Ping Identity in 2011 to provide SSO capabilities via its PingFederate technology.
> 
> Dropbox doesn’t just compete with Box.net, but SugarSync, Google Drive, Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft’s SkyDrive, and a host of smaller services. But it was Dropbox that Box CEO Aaron Levie skewered with an [April Fool’s Day prank](http://www.businessinsider.com/box-ceo-polyhedron-square-dropbox-2013-4). Why? Because Levie can see Dropbox in the rear-view mirror.
> 
> Dropbox’s vast scale — it boasts 100 million users, with 600 million “work files” stored every work week, according to a spokeswoman — represents a threat. Dropbox counts users in 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies, according to Kevin Egan, the vice president of sales that Dropbox hired away from Salesforce.
