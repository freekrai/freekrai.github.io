Daniel Sternlicht:

> A portfolio is a must-have for any designer or developer who wants to stake their claim on the Web. It should be as unique as possible, and with a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you could have a one-of-a-kind portfolio that capably represents you to potential clients. In this article, Iâ€™ll show you how I created my 2-D Web-based game portfolio.

Interesting approach to portfolio design, turn it into a 2D CSS / Javascript-based game..
