Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:

> MacRumors’ own [buyers’ guide](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac) shows a “Don’t Buy” indicator below every Mac except the MacBook. Of the current lineup, fully half of all Macs — the Mac Pro, the Retina MacBook Pro, and the MacBook Air — are the most stale that those products have ever been.

> The Mac Pro hasn’t been substantially updated since the new cylindrical model launched in December of 2013. The pro Macintosh situation is so dire that some designers and developers, like [Mike Rundle](https://medium.com/swlh/building-my-1-200-hackintosh-49a1a186241e) and [Sebastiaan de With](https://twitter.com/sdw/status/705464206665986049), have opted to deal with the moderate hassle of building a “hackintosh” in order to get the performance they need for their work. Critical products like the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pro are well over a year old, too.

There is definitely something going on, with no new hardware releases in a while, and a new MacOS update looming, we _have_ to get updated MacBook Pros and Mac Pros soon (September?), right?

I'm pretty sure we won't see another update for the MacBook Air. I really do  think the Macbook Air  exists solely to occupy that sub-$1000 price range until Apple can sell a year-old MacBook for $899. 

That said, Apple may roll out a minor speed-bump update to the MacBook Airs, but I really don’t expect them to. The future is just MacBooks and MacBook Pros (and iPad Pros).
