Matt Drance:

> That process began some time before October 5, 2011. It ended on June 2, 2014. [Josh Topolsky](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/3/5776030/meet-the-new-apple) kind of said it, [Ben Thompson](http://stratechery.com/2014/steve-jobs-wouldnt-done/) kind of said it, so let’s just say it:
> 
> [This wouldn’t have happened under Steve Jobs.](http://www.bing.com/search?q=this+wouldn%27t+have+happened+under+steve+jobs&form=APMCS1)

> The “Continuity” suite of features says more to me than anything else announced last week, naturally blurring the line between Mac and iPhone and iPad while still accepting each product for what it is. Recent updates to OS X seemed intent on forcing iOS down the Mac’s throat. Last week, for what felt like the first time ever, the two were on equal footing: an Apple device is an Apple device is an Apple device. This shot of creativity, connectivity, integration, and inclusion points to drastic change from within. When I wrote “[Regime Change](http://www.appleoutsider.com/2012/10/30/regimechange/)” in 2012, nearly everyone assumed the title referred to the fall of Scott Forstall. It in fact referred to the rise of Tim Cook.
