<span style="color: #333333;">Andrew Cunnginham, Ars Technica:</span>

> Asus has long offered a line of Android tablets that slot into keyboard docks, but at its Computex press conference it announced it would be taking this concept one step further. Its new Transformer Book Trio is a tablet running Android (an unspecified version of Jelly Bean, to be a bit more precise); when docked, it becomes a Haswell-equipped Windows 8 Ultrabook.

I predict that next yearâ€™s model will be able to cook pizzas.
