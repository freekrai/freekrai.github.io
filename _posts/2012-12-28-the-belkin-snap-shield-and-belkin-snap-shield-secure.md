I’m reviewing both of these products together because they’re really two variations on the same product…

Until recently, I had been using a gelaskin on my iPad, but that doesn’t really provide the full protection I want when I throw it into a laptop bag and go around town with it or on road trips, so I started looking into better protection..

After trying a few others, I came across these two that met my needs, solid protection but not too thick that it doubles the weight of my iPad like some other cases have been known to do.

Both of these cases snap onto the back of your iPad securely, and protect the underside.. I have a Snap Shield for my iPad Mini and a Snap Shield Secure for my iPad 3..

The Snap Shield case is a hard plastic case with a soft-touch rubber finish. Like similar cases, Smart Cover-compatible or not, Snap Shield extends all the way to all four edges of the tablet. All of the openings are clean and precise. Leaving you easy access to your various controls while still keeping the iPad secure.

One thing I like over the Snap Shield Secure, is that it has a magnetic strip on the back that holds your Smart Cover closed when you fold it over. That works nicely, and is where the “secure” comes into play.

Other than that extra feature, the Snap Shield Secure is exactly the same as the Snap Shield case above.

**Conclusion**

One other nice feature about both these cases.. It fits most iPad keyboards, including the [Logitech Ultrathin keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/06/12/ultrathin-keyboard-cover-from-logitech/), that makes this even more useful.
