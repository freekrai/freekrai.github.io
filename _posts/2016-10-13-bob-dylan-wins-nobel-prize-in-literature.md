> Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, organizers announced early Thursday — marking the first time the prestigious award has gone to someone known primarily as a musician. 
> 
> The Swedish Academy cited the 75-year-old music icon for "having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition."
Dylan, who rarely gives interviews, had no immediate comment, according to a representative.
