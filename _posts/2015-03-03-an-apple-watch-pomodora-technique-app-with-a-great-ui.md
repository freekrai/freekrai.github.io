I love using the Pomodoro technique for getting things done in a day, and here’s a handy Swift based code example from Kenny Tang providing an Apple Watch Pomodoro technique inspired time management app with a number of nice features called Cherry.

Cherry has a nice clean interface design, features Core Data based persistence, and Glances for showing activity and allowing you to jump straight into the watch app.

Here are a couple of images showing Cherry in action:

You can find Cherry on [Github here](https://github.com/kenshin03/Cherry).

You can also find KTPomodoro – an Objective-C based version of Cherry with a few less features on [Github here](https://github.com/kenshin03/KTPomodoro).

A nice example of a useful Apple Watch app.
