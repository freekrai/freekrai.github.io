> I’ve been listening to podcasts regularly for almost a decade, and there have always been more great podcasts than I’ve had time to listen to. Podcasting doesn’t have a content problem. More great podcasts are always welcome, but there isn’t a lack of great podcasts holding back the medium.
> 
> Podcast adoption has always been driven primarily by ease of listening, which has improved dramatically with the rise of smartphones, podcast apps, and Bluetooth audio in cars. When it’s easier to listen, not only do more people listen, but listeners find more opportunities to listen. There’s still plenty of potential to help people who already like podcasts listen to more of them
