I used to listen to Marco Arment and John Siracusa on their separate 5by5 podcasts until they decided to end them last month, so it was with delight that I came across this podcast today..

As [Marco says in his introductory post](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/19/neutral1):

> Casey Liss, John Siracusa, and I are doing a new casual car podcast, and here’s its first episode. It might be a miniseries — we’re planning on doing about 8 episodes, and then we’ll decide if we have anything left to talk about.
> 
> Unlike most car podcasts, we’re not focusing on cutting-edge news, horsepower, or racing. Instead, it’s what you’d expect from hearing three computer nerds talk about past and present cars.

And I have to say I like what I’ve heard so far. It will be interesting if they do continue beyond the original planned 8 episodes and where it goes, but its refreshing to hear these guys on a different topic.
