I admit, I prefer Things over OmniFocus.

I’ve used them both, but keep returning to Things.

So this handy set of scripts worked well for displaying upcoming tasks in my Status Board via CSV export and a regularly scheduled script that runs and checks what’s due soon..

I’ve been running this for a few days, and it’s been working well, so thought I’d share.
