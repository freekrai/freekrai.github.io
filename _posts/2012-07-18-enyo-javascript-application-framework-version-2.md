Version 2 of the web-based Enyo application framework – the framework that spun out of webOS – has just exited beta and is now available for developers to use.

Unlike Enyo 1, which was designed specifically for the TouchPad and other doomed webOS products, Enyo 2 is intended to be a completely platform-independent library that can be used to create apps that work across a variety of browsers and mobile devices.
