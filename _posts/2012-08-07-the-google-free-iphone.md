MG Siegler speculating about Apple replacing Google as the default search engine with Bing:

> Microsoft needs Apple to make Bing relevant. Apple needs Microsoft in order to stop paying Google billions. This is so obvious. I think we may see a Google-free iPhone sooner, rather than later.

This could be an interesting collarabation, with Apple dropping their built-in Google apps, is dropping Google as the default search engine the next step?
