The Guardian:

> The US government and police officials are in the midst of a misleading PR offensive to try to scare Americans into believing encrypted cellphones are somehow a bad thing, rather than a huge victory for everyoneâ€™s privacy and security in a post-Snowden era.

I fully understand the position the government is taking on this but, with  
 all the evidence of the authorities spying on us in any number of ways, they have no one to blame but themselves for average citizens looking for ways to protect themselves from their government.

I am all for having my phone encrypted, just like how I always recommend using a VPN when on public internet connections.
