> Feedly is currently suffering a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack, it announced earlier this morning on its [blog](http://blog.feedly.com/2014/06/11/denial-of-service-attack/).
> 
> You may have noticed that you canâ€™t access the website or load any of your feeds via the app. Feedly explained in a short message two hours ago that the DDoS perpetrator is holding Feedly to ransom and asking for money to stop the attack, Feedly has refused to comply.
