> Obviously, summer isn’t here yet. But I know it’s coming because I’ve suddenly been wanting ice cream. When fall turns to winter, I lose my interest in chilly desserts. In summer, I make a whole lot of ice cream and we have it for dessert almost every night.

> I decided to make a pretty simple ice cream – egg free, no cooking. I started with the idea of maple, but than added just a tiny bit of instant coffee. I really liked the result.

Making ice cream at home is one of our favorite summer things to do and this recipe was absolutely tasty…
