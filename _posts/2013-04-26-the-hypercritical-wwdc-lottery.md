John Siracusa:

> But tickets selling out in less than 2 minutes does not reward anyone’s dedication. We were all online at 10 a.m. PDT sharp, all ready to purchase, all equally dedicated. It was a de facto lottery, with an extra layer of pointless stress added on top.

[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2013/04/26/wanting-it-more) posted some interesting thoughts along this as well:

> Before, it was effectively merit-based: whoever cared the most (and had the money and ability) to get a ticket could get one. Now, no matter how much you care and no matter how early you get there, it’s a lottery.
> 
> Many people complained that Apple’s sudden availability in previous years was unfair, and they were right. Everyone didn’t have a fair chance at getting a ticket — only the people who devoted the most to getting one had a good chance of it. Most people who weren’t expecting tickets to go on sale soon, didn’t create or use alerting systems (or slept through them), or just needed time to get approval from their bosses were locked out last year.
> 
> This year, by giving everyone advance notice for the first time, Apple did fix that problem: it is more fair. A similar percentage as last year of interested developers got tickets (or didn’t).
> 
> But now, that core community that I’ve enjoyed for years is fragmented. Our elaborate hacks and dedication previously allowed almost all of us to get tickets, but now, we have the same success rate as everyone else: some got tickets, most didn’t. Apple eliminated our unfair advantage.
> 
> It’s hard for Apple to come up with a better solution if fairness is the goal (and it probably should be). This is the new normal.
> 
> I’m going to miss what we had. But like everything else in this business, it was temporary. That’s what makes it such an exciting business. WWDC will go on, but it’s going to be very different for my friends and me. Here’s hoping that the community finds creative ways to replace what will be lost. Fortunately, it usually does.

I do like the fact that the [\#AltWWDC](http://altwwdc.com) will be held at the same time, that should give those who didn’t get a chance but still want to go to San Francisco a chance to take in some interesting Apple related talks.
