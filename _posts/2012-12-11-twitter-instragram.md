The [Twitter/Instagram](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/) [standoff](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/) has now further escalated into a shooting war.

Actually, the Android version is out, but the iOS version is still pending approval in the App Store. So why announce it today? Perhaps because [Instagram had an update](http://blog.instagram.com/post/37657978245/instagram-3-2-improved-camera-with-a-new-filter) that *did* hit the App Store today. Makes Twitter look pretty petty .
