[Federico Viticci’s review](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/command-c-a-local-clipboard-sharing-tool-for-os-x-and-ios-7/) last week introduced me to an<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> awesome new app for Mac and iOS called </span>[Command-C](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/command-c/id692783673?mt=8&at=10l7j8)<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. It allows you to push the contents of your clipboard between devices over a local network. Thanks to the backgrounding features of iOS 7, you can share between an iPhone and iPad without even having to open the app on the receiving device.</span>

All you do is copy something on one device (like a bit of text, a link, or an image), go into Command-C and choose the device you want to send your clipboard to, and the contents will instantly be made available to paste on that other device.

I also highly suggest you read [Federico’s review](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/command-c-a-local-clipboard-sharing-tool-for-os-x-and-ios-7/) to see some of the other cool stuff you can do with this app using bookmarklets.
