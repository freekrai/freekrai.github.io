Ingrid Lunden, writing for AOL/TechCrunch:

> Fred Wilson of New York’s Union Square Ventures, one of the top tech investors around, believes that by 2020, the biggest tech company in the world — Apple — will cease to be the most important, and won’t even be in the top three.
> 
> Speaking at today’s TC Disrupt conference in NYC, he predicted that the top three tech companies, instead, will be Google, Facebook “and one that we’ve never heard of.”
> 
> Why? Apple, he believes, is “too rooted to hardware,” with not enough tied into the cloud, and that will make it too much of a challenge for it to evolve going forward. “I think hardware is increasingly becoming a commodity,” he said. “Their stuff in the cloud is largely not good. I don’t think they think about data and the cloud.”

In the business world, absolutely anything could happen, especially if our measuring stick is stock price. It’s fairly certain that Apple won’t be the biggest tech company in the world forever.

But let’s not forget who Fred Wilson is…

Fred Wilson is the guy who [sold his Apple stock in 2009 for $91 per share](http://avc.com/2009/01/selling-apple-a/), it closed at $601 yesterday, and who also started pushing for companies he invests in to [develop for Android first](http://avc.com/2010/10/android/) back in 2010.
