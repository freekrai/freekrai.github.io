> Lightweight and compact design with a convenient key ring & integrated charging cables means you’re always ready for a quick charge whenever you need it.

One of the few things worse than carrying around a large battery reserve is having your iPhone run out of power. The brand-new lineup of [mophie Juice Packs](http://www.mophie.com/category-s/53.htm) are sleek and slim.

### So how have I found it after a couple days?

It’s been handy to keep in a pocket for when you find yourself needing that extra boost so your phone doesn’t die before you can get to a charger.

The Reserve is about the size of a zippo, so it doesn’t take up much space unlike some of the others on the market and actually has a pretty decent battery so it gives you more than just an extra 10 minutes of battery power.

### Any cons?

Only works for iPhone (as the name says).

### Recommend to others?

Absolutely, I highly recommend this to anyone with an iPhone who wants to have a little backup battery power on them in case of emergencies.
