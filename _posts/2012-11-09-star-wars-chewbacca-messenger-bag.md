> Crafted of faux leather, it is the perfect size for toting your 11″ MacBook Air, a netbook, or a tablet as well as any other items you need on your daily adventures. The bandolier style shoulder strap is adjustable for heights from Ewok to Wookiee. What does a Wookiee keep in his bag? Extra ammunition, a tin of Hoth Cocoa, and a Han Solo in Carbonite Chocolate Bar, of course!

This bag isn’t for carrying a ton of stuff, it fits an 11″ MacBook Air, an iPad 3 and an iPad Mini nicely, and that’s about it. But it’s handy to take with you to a coffee shop to get some coding or writing done, and it looks cool, with the Chewbacca bandolier style strap..
