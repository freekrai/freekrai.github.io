![Galaxy Note 5 design flaw: A backwards S-Pen can permanently damage the device](http://rogerstringer.com/media/note5.jpg)

> 
> The Galaxy Note 5 has a novel new S-Pen slot design. The Pen inserts flush into the body, and a spring-loaded mechanism ejects it. As Android Police discovered (and we just had to try, too), the new design isn't that robustâ€”gently inserting the S-Pen backwards into the slot can irreparably damage the Note 5.
> 
> The right way to dock the S-Pen into the device is to slide the pointy end in first, but if you slide the blunt end in first, the S-Pen will get jammed in the device. The spring mechanism that holds the pen in will clamp down on the wrong end of the S-Pen and won't let go. It is possible to wiggle the pen free from the spring's hold, but when we tried it, the S-Pen detection features stopped working.
> 
> Normally on the Note 5, removing the S-Pen when the screen is off will launch a quick note taking app, and removing it when the screen is on will launch the radial S-Pen menu. After putting the S-Pen in backwards and wiggling it out, all of these features stopped working.

You'd think they'd have noticed this flaw in their design?
