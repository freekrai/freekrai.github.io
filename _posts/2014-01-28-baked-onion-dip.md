This is a pretty simple recipe, but itâ€™s absolutely tasty with crackers, or pita chips. I love to make this dip for get togethers.

**What You Need:**

- 2 cups sweet onion, peeled and chopped
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- 2 cups Parmesan cheese

**How To Make It:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Prepare a 2 quart baking dish with cooking spray.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, onions and cheese.
4. Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake for approximately 45 minutes, until the top is slightly brown.
5. Serve hot with round crackers or pita chips.
