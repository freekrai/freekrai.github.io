> The case of the status bar might look like a small thing, but I take that as a significant hint. The iOS 7 transparent status bar works best with one app on the screen at a time. Apple being the company that thinks through well before shipping a design, it’s unlikely that they set the status bar transparent in iOS 7 and change course in the next major version.

Sounds about right, either Apple has solutions to all the problems he lists, or this split-screen rumor just isn’t happening.

I guess we’ll see next week at WWDC…
