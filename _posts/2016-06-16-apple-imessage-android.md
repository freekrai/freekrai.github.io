This shouldn’t be all that surprising really, but I think that some people were disappointed iMessage didn’t come to Android this week. I think we _might_ see iMessage on Android in the future, but right now, Apple sees it as an advantage to the iPhone platform on the whole, and that is still king at Apple.
