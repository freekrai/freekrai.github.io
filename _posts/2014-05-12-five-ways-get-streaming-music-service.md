Re/code:

> It took me a while to get into Internet-based “streaming” music services. But I’ve finally warmed up to the idea that music files don’t have to be something that I physically possess.And streaming music services have finally gotten to the point where they offer enough value to offset the occasional interruptions in play or the intrusive ads.

(Beats, of course, may soon be acquired by Apple for $3.2 billion.) There’s a handful of others out there, including Rdio, Songza, Google Play Music and iHeartRadio, but the first four I mentioned are the ones I focused on for this column.

I use Rdio and Google Play Music. I tried out Songza, but it wasn’t quite what I wanted, and Pandora and Spotify aren’t available in Canada currently.

Do you use streaming music services? Which ones? What do you like or dislike about them?
