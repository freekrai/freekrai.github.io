Owen Williams:

> When trimming down your notifications, ask yourself these questions: Am I willing to let this interrupt me at any given moment during my day? Is this information critical to my life?

I did something similar recently, I decided to trim back which notifications I see. The notifications I do get on a regular basis are:

- Email: Emails from my VIP list (which is just my CPA and my wife)
- Twitter DMs
- Slack mentions and direct messages
- Paypal
- Paid for Stripe payments
- Calendar alerts
- Reminders: (time / location)
- Deliveries: when a delivery status changes
- Overcast: new podcast episodes are available
- Circa: breaking news alerts
