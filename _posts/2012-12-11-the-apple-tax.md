Chris Taylor for Reuters:

> Americans are shelling out big bucks annually to outfit the entire household with Apple products. And they are spending hundreds – if not thousands of dollars – more each year for the unexpected Apple “taxes” — add-ons that lock them into the Apple system: iTunes downloads for music, movies and games, along with subscriptions and accessories.
> 
> Then there are the replacement costs for lost or broken equipment. For a family with multiple children, each with their own technological needs, the total annual bill can get downright ugly — like going over a familial “fiscal cliff.”

Comparing Apple customers to those in “indentured servitude” goes so far beyond bad writing that its not even funny..
