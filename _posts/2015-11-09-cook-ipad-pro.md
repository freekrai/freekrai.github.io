Tim Cook, in London for iPad Pro promotional interviews, to The Telegraph:

> “Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones,” Cook argues in his distinctly Southern accent (he was born in Alabama). He highlights two other markets for his 12.9 inch devices, which go on sale online on Wednesday. The first are creatives: “if you sketch then it’s unbelievable… you don’t want to use a pad anymore,” Cook says.

[Cook told The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/tim-cook-apple-ceo-on-the-companys-latest-venture-the-ipad-pro-a6727541.html) in a separate interview that the only devices he’s traveling with are his iPad Pro and iPhone.

Interesting tidbit here:

> Cook hints that Apple may have more plans for the health sphere, in a revelation which will intrigue Wall Street, but he doesn’t want the watch itself to become a regulated, government-licensed health product. “We don’t want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process. I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it — maybe an app, maybe something else.”

Some good remarks on government-mandated encryption backdoors, as well.
