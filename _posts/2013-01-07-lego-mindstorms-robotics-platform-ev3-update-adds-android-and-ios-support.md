> Lego’s Mindstorms robotics system is getting an update with mobile computing in mind. The new EV3 system is based around a revamped, Linux-based “intelligent brick” — the central Mindstorms operating component — that is now compatible with iOS and Android devices out of the box. The latest brick has an ARM9 processor, 16MB of flash memory and 64MB of RAM, and an SD expansion slot, compared to the last-gen NXT brick, which had an ARM7 processor and no expandable memory. As before, multiple bricks can be connected, this time four instead of three.

> On the software side, Lego has also introduced a new 3D instructions app in partnership with Autodesk, allowing users to zoom and rotate building instructions. We don’t have much information yet about this tool, but it’s based on Autodesk’s existing Inventor Publisher software. The new Mindstorms will be released in the second half of 2013 worldwide; kits will cost $349.99.
