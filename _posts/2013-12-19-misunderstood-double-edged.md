Rob McGinley Myers, on his thoughts about Apple’s latest ad, Misunderstood:

> A lot of people are writing about Apple’s latest commercial for the iPhone. Gruber [thinks](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/17/misunderstood "Daring Fireball Linked List: 'Misunderstood'") it’s their best ad of the year, Kottke [calls](http://kottke.org/13/12/apples-best-advertisement-ever "Apple's best advertisement ever?") it one of their best ever. Nick Heer [compares](http://pxlnv.com/linklog/misunderstood/ "Misunderstood — Pixel Envy") it to Don Draper’s[carousel pitch](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DHUUyx0d7qw&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDHUUyx0d7qw "Mad Men - The Carousel (720p HD Version) - YouTube") for the slide projector. But Ben Thompson’s [take](http://stratechery.com/2013/misunderstood/ "Misunderstood | stratēchery by Ben Thompson") is my favorite because he responds to the ad’s critics, who say that Apple is “promoting recording your family over actually spending time with your family.”

Thompson sees the ad as an attempt to bridge the technological/generational divide, to say the *reason* we’re so obsessed with our gadgets is that they can actually do amazing things.

> In the first half of the ad, the kid is portrayed as self-absorbed, antisocial, even rude in his attention to his iPhone. But why? Would we have seen him in such a negative light if he had been reading a copy of *The Catcher in the Rye*, or writing in a journal, or drawing in a sketchpad, or noodling on a guitar? The magical, revolutionary thing about an iPhone (and I say this unironically) is that it can *become* a novel, a journal, a sketchbook, a musical instrument, or a video camera/video editor (with apps like iBooks, Day One, Paper, Garageband, and iMovie among many others).
