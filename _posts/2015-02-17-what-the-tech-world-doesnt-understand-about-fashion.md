Leslie Price's [essay](http://www.racked.com/2015/2/16/8039853/apple-watch-google-glass-fashion-tech) is an interesting read:

> Apple stresses how hyperfunctional its watch will be, though the functions that it performs won’t prove revelatory to anyone who owns an iPhone, which it must be paired with. (That’s right, it’s a $350 accessory of an accessory—and both must be charged nightly.) The iPhone, it should be noted, is ubiquitous not because it’s cool, but because smartphones are considered necessary in our modern times. As it stands, the Apple Watch is neither.

> A “dirty secret” of the wearables market is that at least half of consumers abandon them within months, no doubt realizing how pointless they truly are.

I may not wear my Google Glasses as much as I used to when I first got them, but I still wear my Pebble, but being more of a tech guy, I may be a minority.
