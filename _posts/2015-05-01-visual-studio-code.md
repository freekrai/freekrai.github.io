Casey Liss:

> On Wednesday, during [Microsoft Build][b], Microsoft announced a new code editor
called [Visual Studio Code][c]. Not an [IDE][i], Code is a full-featured code
editor that appears to be based off of the same technology that drives the [Atom][a]
editor, called [Electron][elec]. Since it's running mostly on web technologies, 
Code will run on Windows, OS X, and Linux.
> 
> Code promises to support many different technologies and platforms; at a glance,
one could assume the most interesting thing to a C♯ developer like myself may be
writing C♯ on OS X. Since I so often work with [content management systems][cms],
that's not (usually) an option for me. What appealed to me was the 
[Node.js support][n] and [IntelliSense][is].

I was going to write an article about this myself, but Casey did it so well, I thought I'd link to his post and let him tell you all about it instead.
