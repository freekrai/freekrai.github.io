> Dear Pebblers,
> 
> Thank you all for being such loyal supporters and champions of the Pebble community and brand. You helped start something fantastic when you backed our first Kickstarter project (and shout-out to the first inPulse users). Since then, we’ve shipped over 2 million Pebbles around the world!
> 
> However—due to various factors—Pebble is no longer able to operate as an independent entity. We have made the tough decision to shut down the company and no longer manufacture Pebble devices. This news has several major implications, and we hope to answer as many questions as possible here
> 
> [..]
> 
> **What you need to know**
> 
> - Pebble is no longer promoting, manufacturing, or selling any devices.
> - Pebble devices will continue to work as normal. No immediate changes to the Pebble user experience will happen at this time.
> - Pebble functionality or service quality may be reduced in the future.

I owned one of the first Pebbles, and loved it, and I later bought a Pebble Time when it came out and loved that too, but as time went on, I moved to an Apple Watch and the Pebbles went elsewhere.

I had no problems with the Pebble watches I owned, I just like the look and feel of the Apple Watch better, which is a common thing for most people I've know who owned Pebbles.
