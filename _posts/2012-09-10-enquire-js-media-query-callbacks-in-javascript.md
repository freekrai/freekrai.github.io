> Enquire.js is a lightweight, pure JavaScript library for handling media queries. It is less than 1kb when GZIP’d and minified, and has absolutely no dependencies. Yup, you read that right – no dependencies, not even jQuery! The most you will have to do is provide a matchMedia polyfill if you wish to support browsers without a native implementation.

Interesting way to add Media Queries to older browsers, or other possible solutions that might arise..
