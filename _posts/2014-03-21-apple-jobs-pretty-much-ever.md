> You could be forgiven, after reading “Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,” for concluding that [Apple](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org) is on the verge of going belly up. In the new book by Yukari I. Kane, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, the company is depicted as having radically declined after the death of its former impresario.
> 
> Under [Timothy D. Cook](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/timothy_cook/index.html?inline=nyt-per), who took over as chief executive shortly before [Steve Jobs](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/steven_p_jobs/index.html?inline=nyt-per) died in October 2011, Apple “teeters at the edge of a reckoning,” Ms. Kane writes. Its executives, she adds, “cannot find their own way forward. They are tired. They are uncertain. The well of ingenuity has run dry.”
> 
> After the book’s release earlier this week, [Mr. Cook said in a statement](http://recode.net/2014/03/18/tim-cook-slams-new-book-on-apple/) that it was “nonsense.”
> 
> He’s right.
