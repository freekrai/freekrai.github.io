> The White House announced a set of executive actions and policy recommendations Tuesday aimed at preventing certain patent-holding firms, known as “patent trolls” to their detractors, from abusing the patent system.
> 
> The Obama administration’s actions are intended to target firms that have forced technology companies, financial institutions and others into costly litigation to protect their products.
