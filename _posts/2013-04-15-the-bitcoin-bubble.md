Felix Salmon:

> A few days ago, the [value](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblockchain.info%2Fcharts%2Fmarket-cap%3Ftimespan%3Dall%26showDataPoints%3Dfalse%26daysAverageString%3D1%26show_header%3Dtrue%26scale%3D0%26address%3D) of all the bitcoins in the world blew past $1 billion for the first time ever. That’s an impressive achievement, for a purely virtual currency backed by no central bank or other authority. It’s also temporary: we’re in the middle of a bitcoin bubble right now, and it’s only a matter of time before the bubble bursts.

The first is just that it’s a bubble, and any chart which looks like the one at the top of this post is bound to end in tears at some point. But there’s a deeper reason, too — which is that bitcoins are an uncomfortable combination of commodity and currency. The commodity value of bitcoins is rooted in their currency value, but the more of a commodity they become, the less useful they are as a currency.

Great post on the whole Bitcoin situation and why it’s so interesting.
