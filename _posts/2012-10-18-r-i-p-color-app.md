> Color, the much-hyped startup that raised a whopping $41 million in a first round of funding, is shutting down its flagship video-sharing app just a year after re-launching it, according to VentureBeat.
> 
> The company’s shareholders and board reportedly voted to shut down Color last week following the news that Co-founder and CEO Bill Nguyen had stepped away from his day-to-day duties. “Color is going through a number of changes,” the company said in an e-mail sent out to employees and obtained by VentureBeat. “Last week, the Board and major shareholders voted to wind down the company.”
> 
> As VentureBeat points out, the app may be biting the dust, but Color Labs — the larger company — will likely continue to work on other projects with the money that it still has in the bank.
> 
> Color did not respond to our request for comment.
> 
> Color has been plagued by problems almost from the beginning. The startup managed to obtain an impressive amount of funding thanks in part to the notoriety of its two co-founders. Nguyen, a charismatic entrepreneur, had previously founded and then sold the online music service Lala to Apple for $80 million. Peter Pham, Color’s other co-founder, was the former CEO of the money-saving website BillShrink.

It’s also sad to see once popular startups decide to just shut down…
