> Oculus will not tell me when the long-awaited consumer version of its Rift headset, beloved by PC gamers and dedicated virtual reality enthusiasts, might be released.
> 
> “I know it’s coming,” says company CEO and co-founder Brendan Iribe when I finally ask the question. “No comment. We’re really excited about Gear VR right now.” He’s talking about Oculus’ new attempt to attract casual virtual reality users that the Rift might put off: a partnership with Samsung that turns a Galaxy Note 4 into the screen for a headset fitted with a trackpad, a few volume buttons, and the first-generation Rift’s tracking sensor.
> 
> The Gear VR was made possible in no small part by legendary game developer John Carmack, who left his company id last year to work on the project. The Rift had been shown off to great success at CES 2013, and by the time Carmack visited the Oculus offices to start talking about his move, Samsung had already reached out and delivered a crude prototype. “Some people inside the company had successfully ported the original Oculus SDK to it, and there were a few things running at that point, but running very very badly,” he says. He took on a daunting task: turning an experience usually powered by high-end computers into something that could be handled by a standard smartphone.
