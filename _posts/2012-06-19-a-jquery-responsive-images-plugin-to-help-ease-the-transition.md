jQuery Picture is a plugin that you can use to implement the <picture> tag now for responsive images in your sites.

Iâ€™ve mentioned this tag [before](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/05/21/responsive-images-and-web-standards) and with all responsive design becoming more of an issue lately, having a way to use it now, rather than wait a year or two for it to be widely accepted is handy.
