Jeff Atwood:

> Apple is clearly doing a great job here. Kudos. If you want a device that delivers maximum battery life for light web browsing, there’s no question that you should get something with an Apple logo on it. I just wish somebody could explain to me and Anand why Windows is so awful at managing idle power. We’re at a loss to understand why Windows’ terrible – and worsening! – idle battery life performance isn’t the source of far more industry outrage.
