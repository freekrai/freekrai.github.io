> A decade after its original release, BioWare’s *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic ***[has come to the iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-knights-old-republic/id611436052?mt=8). The game was one of the best RPGs released on the Xbox, and is quite possibly *the* best *Star Wars* game around. But beyond its strong gameplay, the title was lauded for having a better story than the two *Star Wars* prequels released shortly before it. [*IGN* got an early look](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/30/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ipad-review) at the new port, and while they found that movement controls were clunky on the iPad, the experience as a whole remained the same, if not better, on the touch controls. It’s available now for $9.99 and was ported by Aspyr Media, which previously brought the title over to OS X.
