“Underscore” David Smith has a new sleep-tracking Apple Watch app, and actually figured out a reliable routine to keep it charged:

> Today I released a new app [Sleep++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep++/id1038440371?at=10l3KS&ct=sleep&ls=1&mt=8) that uses the motion tracking capabilities of your Apple Watch to monitor how well you are sleeping at night. 
> 
> This is one of the capabilities made possible by the improvements of watchOS 2.
> 
> To use the app you need to wear your Apple Watch while you sleep each night. This presents an obvious problem, when do I charge it?.

Whether this can work for you will depend on how much you discharge your Watch each day.

For example, owners of the 42mm model who don’t use workout mode for very long each day will have the easiest time.

The battery life on the Pebble and Pebble Time vs the Apple Watch have been one of the factors that keep me enjoying my Pebble over the Apple Watch. I charge my Pebble Time once every ten days rather than nightly.
