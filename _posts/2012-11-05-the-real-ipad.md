> My take after spending a bunch of the weekend with the iPad mini: This is the real iPad.

Over at the New York Times, [David Pogue agrees](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/technology/personaltech/presenting-the-nook-hd-ipad-mini-and-windows-phone-8-review.html)

After using the iPad Mini for a few days myself so far, it’s not hard to see the iPad Mini being the “default” iPad for a lot of people. It’s no different than how the iPod touch is now the “default” iPod instead of the original classic with the click wheel.
