MG Siegler:

> Look, at the end of the day all you have to think about is this: do you believe the services you’re using are out to exploit you? If so, don’t use them. Sure, a good TOS may be able to protect you from some of that, but hardly from all of it. If a company wants to fuck you, they’re going to figure out a way to fuck you. You shouldn’t be using a service that you think is trying to fuck you.

I personally don’t believe Instagram is that service. Nor do I believe Facebook is. But if you do, then the solution is simple: don’t use them.
