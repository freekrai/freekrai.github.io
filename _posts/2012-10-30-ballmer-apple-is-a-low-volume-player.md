Steve Ballmer:

> In every category Apple competes, it’s the low-volume player, except in tablets.

And what category do iPhones fall under? You remember iPhones right? That thing that’s as big as your entire company.

Apple is in the top 5 for computer sales in the US, top 5 for music players, apps, phones and tablets…

Ballmer isn’t doing Microsoft any favours, he’s stuck back in his own head more and more every time he does an interview.
