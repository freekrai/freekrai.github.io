Charlie Demerjian:

> In the end, the death spiral for Microsoft is in full effect, and management is expending a lot of effort to speed it up.
> 
> Anyone who dares point out that the entire system is collapsing, or worse yet suggests an alternative, gets Sinofsky’d. Or was it Guggenheimer’d?
> 
> In any case, Microsoft is unwilling to change, and that is very clear.
> 
> Even if they wanted to, they are culturally far beyond the point of being able to. What was a slow bleed of marketshare is now gushing, and management is clueless, intransigent, and myopic.
> 
> Game over, the thrashing will continue for a bit, but it won’t change the outcome.
