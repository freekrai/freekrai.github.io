Mailbox:

> When the Mailbox team joined Dropbox in 2013, we shared a passion for simplifying the way people work together. And solving the email problem seemed like a strong complement to the challenges Dropbox was already tackling.
> 
> But as we deepened our focus on collaboration, we realized there’s only so much an email app can do to fundamentally fix email. We’ve come to believe that the best way for us to improve people’s productivity going forward is to streamline the workflows that generate so much email in the first place.

[Carousel](https://blogs.dropbox.com/carousel/2015/12/thank-you-for-using-carousel/):

> When we introduced Carousel in April 2014, we believed a standalone app would be a better way to experience photos. We’re proud to have created a photo app that many of you use and love. 
> 
> However, over the past year and a half, we’ve learned the vast majority of our users prefer the convenience and simplicity of interacting with their photos directly inside of Dropbox. With this in mind, we’ve had to make a difficult decision.
> 
> On March 31st, we’re shutting down Carousel as a standalone app and returning to a single Dropbox photo experience.

> Apps that get acquired don’t last. Apps that don’t get acquired also don’t last. (Exceptions are rare.)
