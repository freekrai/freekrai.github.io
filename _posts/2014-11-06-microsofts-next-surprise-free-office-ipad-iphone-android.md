> Microsoft’s Office suite for iPad, iPhone, and Android is now free. In a surprise move, the software giant is shaking up its mobile Office strategy to keep consumers hooked to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Starting today, you’ll no longer need an Office 365 subscription to edit documents or store them in the cloud.
> 
>  The move comes just days after [Microsoft announced a strategic partnership with Dropbox](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/4/7153975/dropbox-microsoft-partnership-microsoft-office) to integrate the cloud storage service into Office across desktop, mobile, and the web. You can now download Office for iPad and store all your documents on Dropbox without paying Microsoft anything at all. Microsoft is also releasing [a brand new iPhone app](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7166589/office-for-android-tablets-preview) today, alongside a preview of Office for Android tablets, all with Dropbox integration.
