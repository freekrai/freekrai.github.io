Paperless is a brand new iBookstore book from David Sparks. He wrote it in iBooks Author and, in addition to being full of great information and how-tos, it’s jam packed with slideshows, screencasts, and Retina display graphics.

I’ve been slowly working towards setting up a paperless office, so I bought my copy yesterday. It’s just $5 in the iBookstore.
