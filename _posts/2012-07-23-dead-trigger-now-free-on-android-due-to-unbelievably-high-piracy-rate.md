Aaron Souppouris, writing for The Verge:

> Dead Trigger, a zombie FPS for smartphones from the makers of Shadowgun, is now free to download on Android thanks to rampant piracy on the platform. In a statement on Facebook, developer Madfinger Games says that even at $0.99, the piracy rate on Android devices was “unbelievably high.”

This is sad to hear, I actually did pay for the game on both Android and iOS and I like playing it on my Nexus 7.
