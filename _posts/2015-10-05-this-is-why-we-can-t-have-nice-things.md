M.G Siegler:

> When [the news](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices) hit a few days ago that Amazon would be banning the sale of Apple TV and Google Chromecast devices from their site I was shocked…

> To be fair, it is a _little_ surprising that Amazon would take such a strong action against two partners that they work closely with in other areas (on iPhones/iPads/Android devices, etc). But this seems like par for the course when it comes to technology in the living room. That is to say, if there is a way to make things as frustrating as possible for consumers, those competing in the space will find that way and execute on that plan.

> For years, we’ve been told by various technology companies that they’ve figured out the living room. Sony had it “figured out” with Playstation. Microsoft had it figured out with Xbox. Google had it figured out with Google TV. And Apple is [seemingly always](https://500ish.com/hobby-no-more-9856ab5f3c90) on the verge of [“cracking” it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/jobss-final-plan-an-integrated-apple-tv/2011/10/21/gIQAvhUl3L_story.html) — including, perhaps, later this month with the [_new_](https://500ish.com/the-wii-for-real-this-time-aa734ebf71d7) Apple TV.

We've been `cable cutters` for a few years now, using mostly Netflix, Hulu Prime, Amazon Instant Video, and a few other services, but I can understand where M.G is coming from, it would be nice if it was all centralized in one place, and yes, airplay does make this less of an issue, but it's still an issue.

I was always surprised that Amazon sold Google and Apple streaming devices after they released their own, so their decision to finally stop selling it is expected.
