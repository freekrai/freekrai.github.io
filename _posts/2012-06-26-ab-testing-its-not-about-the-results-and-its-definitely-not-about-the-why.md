> In college, I worked for a couple of years in a lab that tested the effectiveness of surgical treatments for ACL rupture using industrial robotics. Sometimes, the reconstructions didn’t hold. The surgeons involved were sometimes frustrated; it can be hard to look at data showing that something you did didn’t work. But for the scientists and engineers, all that mattered was that we’d followed our testing protocol and gathered some new data. I came to learn that this attitude is exactly what it takes to be a successful scientist over the long term and not merely a one-hit wonder.

Good reading on A/B Testing to keep in mind, and it’s something I’ve said to people for a while when they start talking about A/B Testing.
