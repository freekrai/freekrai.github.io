Jason Snell reporting on [PCalc’s](http://pcalc.com/) rejection for having the audacity of making a very nice Notification Center widget, in the fully supported way, that includes a little calculator:

> This is an app that was accepted into the App Store, and is even being featured in the App Store as I write this. And now, a few weeks in, someone at Apple has decided that the app is too… what? Too useful?

Like the after-the-fact rejection of [Launcher](http://al.cromulentlabs.com/thanks/) last month, this feels like the [worst](http://www.macworld.com/article/1135527/appstore.html) era of app review returning with a vengeance.

By limiting the usefulness of Notification Center widgets, what is Apple protecting itself or its customers from?
