Ever wonder why so little work happens in your office? It could be the workplace itself that’s the problem. 37Signals’ Jason Fried has a radical theory of working: that the office isn’t a good place to do it.

In his talk, he lays out the main problems. Listen and learn as he explains how to create a place where all the members of your team can actually do the work they’re there to do.
