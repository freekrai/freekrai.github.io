> Organic Root Beer Float Tea – Sweet And Lightly Creamy Black Tea Blend With Vanilla, Cinnamon And White Chocolate

Yup, I’m reviewing another tea :)

When I was a kid, we used to make home made root beer, and this is what this reminds me off.. The Vanilla, Cinnamon, hint of white chocolate coupled with the scent of sassflower, combine to make this a sweet, but not too sweet, drink.

I’m actually drinking an iced class of this right now as I type this, and I have another cup steeping in my infuser to down as soon as I finish. It’s that good..

If there’s a David’s Tea near you, definitely order this and try it out. You will not be sorry.
