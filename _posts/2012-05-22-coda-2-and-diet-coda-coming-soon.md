This Thursday, we’ll see [Coda 2](http://panic.com/coda/) and [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda/) finally hitting “shelves”.

This should be interesting, some long awaited features like Git support will be nice to have, and Diet Coda will be handy on iPad where I currently use Koder for that work.
