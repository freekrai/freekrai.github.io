> Travel through stunning landscapes straight out of an animated film. Battle painstakingly hand-animated foes in strategic, turn-based combat harkening back to the classic “Tactics” days of gaming. Make decisions with consequences in conversations with people you’ll truly care about.
> 
> And throughout the whole thing record the history of your people on your banner where it will be remembered, because soon there might not be anything left.
