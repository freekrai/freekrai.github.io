Romain Dillet, reporting for TechCrunch:

> It’s cleaning time in the App Store. Apple sent an email to its developer community indicating that there will be some upcoming changes in the App Store. If an app no longer works or is outdated, it’s going to get removed from the App Store. And it’s about time.

> [...]
> 
> And Apple is not going to stop at abandoned apps. The company will also fight spammy app names. For instance, if you search for “Instagram” on the App Store, one of the first results is an app that is called “[app name] Photo Collage, Picture Editor, Pic Grid, F…” and then it gets cut off.

The thing with abandoned apps, is that developers have to continue renewing their license or the app disappears, so these are apps that have ceased development for a long time, and yet someone keeps paying to keep it there.
