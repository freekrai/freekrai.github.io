Marco reviews his Retina MacBook Pro:

> **This is the best computer I’ve ever used.** And I can say that with no hesitation, qualification, or equivocation.

It’s about the same as everyone else has said when they’ve used them..

In fact, I have [yet](http://brooksreview.net/2012/06/sexy-pro/) to [read](http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/pixel_perfect) a [review](http://garre.tt/the-retina-macbook-pro) of the Retina MacBook Pro that didn’t say something along the lines of “this is the best computer ever”.
