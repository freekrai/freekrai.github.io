Phil Schiller:

> The iPad is far and away the most successful product in its category. The most affordable product we’ve made so far was $399 and people were choosing that over those devices
> 
> And now you can get a device that’s even more affordable at $329 in this great new form, and I think a lot of customers are going to be very excited about that

In plain non-business speak: We are going to sell a metric shit ton of these things.
