A rather scathing review of Windows 8:

> The email app is horrendous. It is the worst email client I have ever used. It’s a full-screen Metro abomination that hides or is missing basic and vital functionality (search, column sorting, filtering). It’s full-screen, but only shows a small sample of your messages — so the screen real-estate is massively wasted. If you have multiple email accounts, there’s no combined inbox view. It’s slow to check and sync your email — unless you force a manual refresh. And the first time you use it, you will struggle to find the ‘send email’ button. Pro-tip — it’s the (+) in the top right.

Thanks to my bizspark account, I’ve installed Windows 8 and played with it,a nd noticed a few issues like what Tim is mentioned here..
