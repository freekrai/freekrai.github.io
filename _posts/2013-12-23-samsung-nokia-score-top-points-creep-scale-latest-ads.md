Samsung just released their “Are you Geared Up” ad to promote their Samsung Gear watch:

And Nokia just released their “Hairdresser’s assistant” ad to promote their Lumia 2520 tablet.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7xVrI-tUIQ?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" type="text/html" width="640"></iframe></span>

Both of these really don’t sell the products, they do get people talking about the products, but selling the products? No!

In the Samsung ad,  two men on a ski lift compete for the attention of a woman sitting between them. One man has a Galaxy Gear, while the other does not. The man with the Gear snaps pictures of his new crush, asks her to repeat her number out loud so his Gear can record it, and follows her down the mountain and he takes pictures of her. It’s a creepy affair.

Throughout the clip, his rival drops his skis, phones, and drinks as he attempt to check his phone — accidents that a Gear smart watch can supposedly help you avoid.

 While the Nokia ad… well… that is just something that makes no sense, but apparently, if you have a Lumia 2520, you can grow a mullet or get a haircut just by using the tablet…

Yeah… They did that…
