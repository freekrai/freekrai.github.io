> We suspected it from the outset, but up until now, we haven’t actually heard it confirmed from the mouth of a Google honcho: Google Glass runs on Android.
> 
> The tidbit was dropped on today’s earnings call, with CEO Larry Page uttering: “*Obviously, Glass runs on Android, so [Android] has been pretty transportable across devices, and I think that will continue.*”
> 
> The response was given to a question regarding engagement increment, but Page stopped short of divulging details about version type. We’re guessing it does a fine job of integrating snippets of Google Now, however, so make of that what you will.

No surprise really…
