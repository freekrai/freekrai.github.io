Heck, I might even have a chance to finish this story instead of letting it tumble around in my head, spitting out phrases while I’m cutting into the right lane to avoid the car in front of me.

She’ll build a world in “creative mode” with a swimming pool full of wool and probably a library. Her world will be blissfully threat-free until she switches over to “survival mode,” when the creepers, zombies, and pigs appear. “There are also spiders, Mommy,” she tells me, reading over my shoulder, “and pig men.”

My 5 year old loves to play minecraft and watch minecraft videos so when I read this post.. I just had to share it.

Currently, Kaitlyn is working on making her idea of what our house looks like in minecraft.. Which is interesting.
