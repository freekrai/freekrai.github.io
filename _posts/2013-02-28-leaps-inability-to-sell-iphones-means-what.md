Leap isn’t selling as many iPhones as it expected to. But it has to be Apple’s fault, right?

Let’s see:

> Leap, which has about 5.3 million total subscribers, is also handicapped by the fact it lacks the robust nationwide networks of the country’s biggest carriers, and because technological limits mean it can’t sell the iPhone in all of its markets.

Oh, and this could be a trigger for lack of sales as well:

> Leap, on the other hand, is selling the iPhone for more money up front—$500 for the latest model—but doesn’t requiring customers to sign contracts and charges less per month than other carriers do.
