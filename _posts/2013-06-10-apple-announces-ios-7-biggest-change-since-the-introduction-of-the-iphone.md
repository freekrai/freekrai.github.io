> Apple has officially taken the wraps off of iOS 7 at its Worldwide Developer Conference today. iOS 7 is the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system that debuted back in 2007 on the original iPhone. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, iOS 7 is the biggest change to the platform since the iPhone was introduced five years ago. The new design is evident in everything from sharper, flatter icons, slimmer fonts, a new slide to unlock function, and a new control panel that slides up from bottom for frequently accessed settings. The stock apps have all been redesigned — including a major revamp of the weather app with new animations that is scarily reminiscent of the recent Yahoo Weather.

>  Apple’s head of design Jony Ive notes that all of the icons have been redesigned with a new palette of colors. Flat is very prominent in iOS 7, everything from the buttons to the switches to the chrome surrounding apps has been modernized and flattened. The calendar, phone, messages, Game Center, and others have all lost their skeuomorphic designs and all feature clean, flat layouts. The signal bars have been also replaced with a series of dots.

Looks good.. the new control center has some interesting uses.. No more flashlight apps on your iPhone.. Improvements to Safari.. Flat UI.. Changes to Messages.. Notifications.. Multitasking.. Air Drop.. Camera changes..

Interesting set of photo filters in the camera app.. And improvements to the Photos app as well..

All in all, iOS 7 looks pretty good..
