James Struthers is an up and coming musician hailing from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

He wrote this song while attending university in Kelowna, BC, 45 minutes from here.

He’s also performing at the [Voodoo Lounge here in Penticton this Friday (April 27th)](http://jamesstruthers.com/Gigs/).

He’s got an interesting sound. Not necessarily my usual music, but worth listening to.
