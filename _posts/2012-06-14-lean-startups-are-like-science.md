And speaking of the LessEverything guys, here’s an interesting post they just did yesterday about Lean Startups…

> We work with a lot of startups, and most of them these days aim to be a “lean startup”.
> 
> The only problem is that folks always seem to misunderstand what a lean startup is or how to apply the techniques.
> 
> Ultimately, a lean startup is no different from any other business.
> 
> You need to find a balance between sales, marketing, bookkeeping, customer development and building your product.
> 
> The right balance depends on your product, your personality and your staff.
