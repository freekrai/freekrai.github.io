> The powerstation is our most powerful battery yet, boasting 4000 mAh and super highoutput charging with unmatched capacity for its compact size.

I’ve reviewd the [Mophie Juice Pack Reserve External iPhone Charger](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/04/25/mophie-juice-pack-reserve-portable-iphone-charger-battery) before, and today I’m reviewing the Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation.

This charger is a little bigger than the Juice Pack and holds a stronger charge.

You can use it to charge anything that charges from a USB cable: iPhones, iPads, Nexus 7, Galaxy Nexus, the list goes on, so it’s a little more useful than the Juice Pack Reserve.

I’ve found it was able to charge my iPhone pretty quickly and since it’s about the same size as my iPhone, fit in my pocket pretty easily to carry around as a backup.

To top this off, while the Juice Park Reserve charges my iPhone about 40%, the Powerstation can charge it 100% so that is really handy.
