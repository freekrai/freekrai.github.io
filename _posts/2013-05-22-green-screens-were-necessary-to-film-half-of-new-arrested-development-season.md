> We’ve already been told a fifth season of Arrested Development on Netflix is unlikely due to scheduling issues with the show’s busy ensemble. But it turns out show creator Mitch Hurwitz barely managed to get everyone together for season four — set to debut on the streaming service this weekend. In fact, he often couldn’t.
> 
> In an interview with Rolling Stone, Hurwitz admitted that not only were episodes and scenes shot out of order to accomodate cast members, but even more worrying, he says “half of the stuff is on green screen.” He cites one example to illustrate the challenges show runners faced: an on-screen conversation Michael (Jason Bateman) and Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) required the actors to film their lines four months apart. “This is, to me, one of the craziest things of this,” Hurwitz said. The entire cast did manage to assemble for two days of shooting, however.

Yikes! Filming parts of a conversation four months apart?
