Matt Burns, TechCrunch:

> The $999 11-inch MacBook Air is Apple’s low-end device. Like the Surface RT, it offers just enough power to get by and nothing more. I wouldn’t recommend the base Air model for anyone that wants to venture outside of iPhoto or the web browser. It’s not a work machine; the $999 MacBook Air is a Facebook machine.

Ok, and yet, people everywhere (myself included) use MacBook Airs daily as their go to machine running Photoshop, Fireworks, Coda, editing audio and video, and even building iPhone apps on it all day without a hitch.. But he claims its just a facebook machine..

The air is also one of the top selling MacBooks around, and in use by developers of all sorts..

TechCrunch is really really starting to aim for the status of “Don’t ever read my articles” after this one..
