Joshua Topolsky writing for The Verge:

> Here it is, Apple’s new iPad mini. As you can see, it’s certainly smaller than the regular iPad, although at 7.9 inches it’s not as small as you’d expect — compared to the Nexus 7, it’s noticeably larger. That said, it’s still an incredibly thin and light design.
