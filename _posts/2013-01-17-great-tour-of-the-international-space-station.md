> Sunita Williams was in charge of the International Space Station for six months. On her last day in space, she made this 25-minute video — a much more in-depth tour of the ISS than I’ve personally ever seen before. This is the first time I’ve actually been able to get a sense of the whole interior layout of the ISS, rather than just seeing one place and then another with no understanding of how they connect. What’s more, you really get a sense of the unearthly weirdness of moving through this space where walls are never just walls and “up” and “down” are essentially meaningless.
