> With Microsoft facing a trademark claim over use of the word “Metro,” it is busy eliminating all mention of the word in reference to the user interface for Windows 8. As if the story weren’t strange enough already, it got quite a bit weirder this week.

I understand the reasoning behind this.. But how far will they push it? Will they make an app designed to help check metro bus schedules change their name too?
