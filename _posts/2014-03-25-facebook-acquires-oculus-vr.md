Mark Zuckerberg:

> I’m excited to announce that we’ve agreed to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology.
> 
> Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we’re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences.
> 
> This is where Oculus comes in. They build virtual reality technology, like the Oculus Rift headset. When you put it on, you enter a completely immersive computer-generated environment, like a game or a movie scene or a place far away. The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you’re actually present in another place with other people. People who try it say it’s different from anything they’ve ever experienced in their lives.
> 
> Oculus’s mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences.

This news has had mix reactions, I personally like [Notch’s](https://twitter.com/notch/status/448586381565390848) reaction over Twitter best:

> We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.

I think we’ll see more of these, as game publishers decide on whether they want their games to become facebook games or not…
