> We have reached a point in which mobile games couldn’t even be said to be a game anymore. Playing a game means that you have fun. It doesn’t mean that you sit around and wait for the game to annoy you for so long that you decide to pay credits to speed it up.

Comparing the original Dungeon Keeper with the new mobile version of the game is a pretty convincing way to prove your point.. In-app purchases are making games lose something..
