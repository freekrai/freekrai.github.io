Dr. Drang makes an interesting prediction regarding the future of [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/), after lamenting his recent litany of replacement credit cards:

> As I said after the September keynote, I like everything about Apple Pay and hope it’ll reduce the credit card fraud problem, but despite the cooperation of many banks I find it hard to believe Apple Pay will become ubiquitous. Apple users make up only a fraction of credit card users, and the banks will be forced to come up with their own solution. When that happens, if it’s done right, support for Apple Pay will fade.
