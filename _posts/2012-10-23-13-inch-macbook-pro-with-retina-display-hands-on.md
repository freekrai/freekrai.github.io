> It’s not quite as thin as the Air, but Apple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display is still quite svelte — and the display is as gorgeous as you’d expect. The resolution settings for the display are just like the larger MacBook Pro — but the maximum allowed resolution is 1680 x 1050, unlike the 1920 x 1080 setting offered on the 15-inch model. Still, 1680 x 1050 is a tremendous option on a display of this size, though at the “best for Retina” setting the screen offers an effective 1280 x 800. If you’ve been using a 15-inch MacBook Pro for the screen size, the 13-inch just got a ton more attractive.
