Gary Gibson:

> I get ideas for books in one or two different ways. The first is by daydreaming, often in the weirdest damn places, while the second is stumbling across some random paragraph in a non-fiction book or article that sets my spider-sense tingling.

This is a nice, share-worthy piece, and while the books I write may not be novels, I take a similar approach, this also happens when I write tutorials about neat ways to use code, once you feel your “spider-sense tingling”, you just have to write about that idea.
