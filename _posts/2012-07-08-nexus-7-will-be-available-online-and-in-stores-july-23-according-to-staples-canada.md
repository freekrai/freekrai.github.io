Looks like Staples Canada has started to take pre-orders for the Google Nexus 7 tablet. The price is the same as if you ordered it through the Play Store, but it looks like they only have the 16GB version for $259 outright.

Google said the Nexus 7 would arrive sometime “late July,” but gave no actual fixed date as to when. Today Staples Canada has posted an estimated date of Monday, July 23rd.

“Pre-order your Google Nexus 7 Tablet to reserve one of these limited quantity tablets. Estimated sku release date is July 23, 2012. Your credit card will be charged at the time of shipment.”

No word on how many they have yet…
