Chris Welch, writing for The Verge:

> Apple is adding a cheaper 8GB iPhone 5C to its smartphone lineup. The new model first appeared on[ UK carrier O2’s site](https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/refreshTariffs/apple/iphone-5c-8gb-blue/), but has since been added to a number of international Apple Stores including the UK, Australia, and China. In the UK, [it’s priced at £429](http://store.apple.com/uk/buy-iphone/iphone5c), £40 ($66 including sales tax) less than the 16GB model. At the moment, it hasn’t been announced in the US where the price would likely fall somewhere around $499.

> Aside from a reduced amount of storage, the latest iPhone 5C is identical in every way to the hardware that launched back in September. It features a 4-inch Retina display, Apple’s A6 processor, and an 8-megapixel camera. Reports of an 8GB model began surfacing on German Apple rumor sites Monday, with a photo of the device’s packaging later appearing [at *Engadget*](http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/17/apple-could-launch-8gb-iphone-5c-rumor/). It was rumored that the 8GB model could replace the iPhone 4S, but for now Apple is still selling that phone alongside the low-price 5C.

> It’s not unprecedented for Apple to [switch up storage options](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/02/05Apple-Adds-New-iPhone-iPod-touch-Models.html) in the middle of [an iOS product’s lifecycle](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/29/3928066/apple-announces-128gb-ipad-with-retina-display), but the company usually adds more room for photos, music, and apps rather than take it away. The introduction of a cheaper iPhone 5C may serve as the best evidence yet that Apple’s mid-level smartphone is [falling short of expectations](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/23/4844698/is-the-apple-iphone-5c-a-success). Apple’s executives have never expressed disappointment with the iPhone 5C, and calling the handset a dud is by no means fair. So far, it’s selling better than the 4S did when it occupied the middle slot in the iPhone portfolio last year.

This comes after Apple replaced the iPad 2 with the iPad 4 as their cheaper full-size model iPad. This is pointing towards replacing the 4S with the 8GB 5C, and thus completely dropping support for the non-Lightning chargers…
