Matt Gemmell on the small screen of the 11-inch MacBook Air:

> There’s no substitute for motivation, self-moderation and focus, but there’s also nothing inherently limiting about small screens. You absolutely can have the best of both worlds: your entire office in an envelope, without feeling that you’re being held back.

Great piece. I spent years using an 11-inch MacBook Air, and just upgraded to a 13-inch MacBook Pro back in November simply because I wanted a retina display, but there are days when I work off of an iPad, so I can agree with what Matt is writing here.
