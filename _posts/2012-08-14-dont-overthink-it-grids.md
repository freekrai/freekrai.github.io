Chris Coyier:

> The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a “main content area” floated to the left a “sidebar” floated to the right, it’s a simple grid.
> 
> If a more complex layout presents itself, people often reach for a grid framework. They assume grids are these super difficult things best left to super CSS nerds. That idea is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of the grid systems they reach for are very complicated.
> 
> Here’s how I build grids. It’s not hard or complicated. Even making them flexible is no big deal.

Interesting approach to grid layouts by Chris Coyier over on CSS-Tricks…
