Photographer and Lucasfilm CG/Lighting/FX Supervisor [Joel Aron](http://www.joelaron.com/)) and LucasArts composer Jesse Harlin collaborated to create “[A Eulogy for Lucas Arts](http://imgur.com/a/0fIIt#NCvJo1N),” a collection of portraits accompanied by moving words celebrating the people of LucasArts.

“Ask gamers to recall George Lucas’ gaming company and they’ll tell you about fulfilled childhood fantasies inside the cockpit of a TIE Bomber or laugh with you about insult sword fighting,” one caption reads.

“The people who lived their lives making games for LucasArts did so because they loved to make games for LucasArts and its fans,” read another. “In large part this was because most of us were fans before we worked there.”
