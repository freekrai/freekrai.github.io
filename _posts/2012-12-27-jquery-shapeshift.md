[**Query.Shapeshift**](http://mcpants.github.com/jquery.shapeshift/) is a jQuery plugin that lets you create grids that automatically arrange themselves, with drag-and-droppable boxes. The effect can be animated or not, and you can even disable the dragging interface for set layouts. The grid is responsive and even works on touch devices.
