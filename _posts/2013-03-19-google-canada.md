Bryan Bishop, for The Verge:

> Google has been putting some weight behind its Chromebook line lately, and now it’s making them available to a lot more potential customers. The company is announcing that Chromebooks from Acer, HP, and Samsung will now be available in a number of new countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. Those in the United States will also find it a little easier to pick up a Chrome OS machine, as Best Buy will begin carrying Chromebooks in every location that sells computers. According to Google, that will double the number of US stores that carry the Chromebook line in the US. Whether increased availability will help the computers gain a toehold in the market, however, is another question entirely.

My wife has had a Chromebook for a while, and Best Buy in Canada has been talking about getting Chromebooks since January, originally they had said they would have them for the end of February, but the current release date is now April 5, 2013.

Either way, it’s about time that Canada finally officially gets Chromebooks.
