Robert McGinley Myers:

> What makes the iPad stand out from other tablet computers, and what makes it so much more appealing, is that it was designed with intimacy in mind. And I think we’re just on the cusp of discovering how that intimacy affords different kinds of behaviors, different kinds of creativity and productivity.

Great article by Rob,  and one of the reasons why I like the iPad over other tablets, I’ve used the Surface, various Android tablets and various Windows tablets and the iPad is the tablet I keep coming back to.
