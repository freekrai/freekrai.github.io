Great idea, and handy API…

> Ziptastic is a simple API that allows people to ask which Country,State and City are associated with a Zip Code.

> The purpose for this service is to STOP the madness of having to fill those information out on webforms. If you’ve ever filled out a webform, then you have probably gotten to the address section and simply entered in your street information and then your city, state, country and then your zip code. This has always bothered me because the 3 fields prior to the zip code can be determined from the zip code!
