Twelve South, makers of high-quality accessories for Mac and iOS devices, have launched the [SurfacePad for iPad mini](http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/surfacepad-for-ipad "SurfacePad for iPad mini - Twelve South") this week, a new entry in the [SurfacePad](http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/surfacepad-for-iphone "SurfacePad for iPhone - Twelve South") line of products that aims at protecting your iPad with a leather case that adheres to the iPad and that also works as a hands-free viewing stand and typing wedge.

Made of premium Napa leather, the SurfacePad covers both the front and back of the iPad mini, using a “special adhesive” to hold the mod cover in place in the back of the device. According to Twelve South, the adhesive leaves no sticky marks or residue on the iPad’s aluminum case, and it can be removed and reapplied at any time with ease.

Because of the thinnes of the case (0.1 inches/3 mm), when opening the front cover of the SurfacePad to use the iPad the experience should be similar to Apple’s Smart Cover, which, however, only protects the device’s display. As with Apple’s cover, the SurfacePad incorporates magnets to wake the iPad and put it to sleep when opened/closed.
