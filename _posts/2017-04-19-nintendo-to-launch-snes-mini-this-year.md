Tom Phillips, writing for Eurogamer, reporting that Nintendo will follow up its successful NES Classic with an SNES Classic later this year:

> The SNES mini (or, to continue Nintendo’s official branding, likely the Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System) is currently scheduled to launch in time for Christmas this year. Development of the device is already under way, our sources have indicated.

Last week, Nintendo ended speculation about the NES Classic by announcing that they were done with it, which let many people wondering what Nintendo was up to as this was one of their most popular systems to date.

Eurogamer’s report claims that the reason Nintendo made no more—_besides claiming it was never intended to be a permanent product_—is that it ran up against production ramping up for the SNES Classic.

This could be interesting to see.
