Or as [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2012/08/22/twitter-cuts-off-tumblr-friend-finding) put it:

> This looks like some serious bullshit on Twitter’s part

I know Tumblr and Twitter have always had a good relationship and Tumblr was even working with Twitter to be a major Cards partner.

So this is how Twitter treats its “partners”?
