Shawn Blanc’s take on the [Lukas Mattis’ Surface](http://rogerstringer.com/2014/03/02/windows-8-and-the-microsoft-surface/ "Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface") post this past weekend

> The always astute, Lukas Mathis, wrote [a fantastic article](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2014/03/02/windows_8_surface/) about why he switched from an iPad to a Microsoft Surface so he could finally do “real work” using a tablet:

I’ve never had any problem doing work on my iPad, I actually like the no-distractions aspect of the iPad, where you have one app taking over the screen to a time. But I can also see where Lukas tends to prefer the Windows tablet.

Myself, I agree with Shawn, and the apps he names are apps I use every day when I work on my iPad, as well as a few others such as Poster for blog posts (such as this one right now).
