Sadly, I’ve known a few people who fall into this category..

> Everyone has a friend who packs all the gear, but has no idea. When it comes to photography, that means mates who run around with their shiny new DSLR, mouthing off about their love of photography, with next to no idea of how to use any of their kit. This video boils that right down.
> 
> These people aren’t hard to spot: they make a song and dance out of composition; their pointless integrated flash pops up when they don’t expect it; and above all, they talk about their kit, rather than just using it. We all know one: do the stereotypes match up with a friend of yours?
