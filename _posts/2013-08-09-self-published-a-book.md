> It all started with a few months ago with a week-long miniseries on [*Shawn Today*](http://shawnblanc.net/members/shawntoday/). The topic was “the importance of delight in design.”
> 
> The feedback from that miniseries was quite positive, and I really enjoyed the subject matter. So I had this idea of re-record the miniseries, polish it up a bit more, and selling it for a few bucks as a for-pay podcast of sorts.
> 
> Well, as you already may have guessed, the project spiraled into what became [*Delight is in the Details*](https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/).
> 
> As I was re-writing the outline for the updated miniseries, I began adding more and more episodes. It turned into 7 parts and then 9.

Shawn Blanc has a great article on how he recently self-published his new book, including the tools he used and the problems he ran into. Worth a read.
