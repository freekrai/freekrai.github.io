Microsoft is finalizing designs for a 7-inch Xbox Surface gaming tablet which will run a custom version of Windows, The Verge reports.

The tablet will include an ARM processor and high-bandwidth RAM designed specifically for gaming, according to the report which cites multiple sources within the company.

The Verge also reports that the device is likely to ship prior to Microsoftâ€™s still-unannounced, but oft-rumored future Xbox console.
