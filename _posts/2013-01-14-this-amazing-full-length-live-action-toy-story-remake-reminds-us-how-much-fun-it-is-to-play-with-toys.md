> This is pretty damn incredible. Since June 2010, [Jonason Pauley and Jesse Perrotta](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Live-Action-Toy-Story-Project/176760992394118) have been filming a shot-for-shot live-action remake of Pixar’s *Toy Story*, using human actors as the human characters and real toys for Woody and the gang (and the original *Toy Story* audio track). The toys move with a combination of stop-motion photography and good old-fashioned puppet strings and wires. Even at its crudest execution, this movie is pure joy to watch; it’s a clear (and incredibly detailed) labor of love, but it’s clear the young filmmakers had a great deal of fun with their plastic actors. Clear out an hour and a half in your Sunday and watch this thing.
