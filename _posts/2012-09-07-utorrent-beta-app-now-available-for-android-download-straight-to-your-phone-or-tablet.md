Kimber Streams writing for The Verge:

> Earlier this year, we heard reports that BitTorrent was working on an Android version of its popular uTorrent client, and today the popular file-sharing service has released a working beta version in the Android app store. Unlike the uTorrent remote app, the new uTorrent beta app lets you download, upload, search for torrents, and subscribe to RSS feeds of content from your mobile device.
> 
> The app is a great way to burn through all of your data plan — and then some — and the app’s creators recommend using WiFi when possible. Because the app is still in beta, it still has a few kinks to iron out — for example, backspace doesn’t function entirely right in the search bar.
> 
> Even if it isn’t perfect, the app is free and available now on Google Play for those with Android version 2.1 or later

I’ve used the BitTorrent client for Android, and also used Swarm, so I’m looking forward to trying this one out as well..
