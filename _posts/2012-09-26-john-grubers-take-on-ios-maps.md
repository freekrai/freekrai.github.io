Interesting post from John Gruber on the recently revealed news that Apple and Google still had a year left on their maps contract..

> So Apple’s options were:
> 
> 1. Continue for one more year with iOS Maps as it was — no turn-by-turn directions, no vector-based map tiles — and thus go for another year at significant feature disadvantage to all other major phones on the market, and then face the same decision one year from now.
> 2. Work out a new deal with Google, granting Google more prominent branding and more (and more personally identifying — that’s what [Latitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude) is all about) location data from iOS users in exchange for modern features like turn-by-turn and vector map tiles. More Google branding, less user privacy.
> 3. Cut the cord with Google now and go ahead with Apple’s own mapping services — which have been in development for years, [with several prominent acquisitions of mapping technology companies](http://9to5mac.com/2012/05/11/ios-6-apple-drops-google-maps-debuts-in-house-maps-with-incredible-3d-mode/) — so that they can add turn-by-turn directions, greatly improve the aesthetics of the map graphics, use vector map tiles, add the visually impressive Flyover mode, and, most importantly, take control of their own destiny.
> 
> We’re supposed to believe Google was surprised that Apple chose #3? Ask yourself this: Were *you* surprised Apple chose option 3?
> 
> This option came with a [now-well-known](http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/) price: the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the underlying cartographic data. But all three of those options came with a heavy price.
> 
> Option 1 meant iOS Maps would spend an entire year falling further behind all of Apple’s competitors.
> 
> Option 2 would grant Google — now Apple’s archrival — more branding, more control, and more access to user data on Apple’s platform.
