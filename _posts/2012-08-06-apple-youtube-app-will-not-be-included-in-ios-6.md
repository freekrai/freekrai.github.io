> Apple obviously did away with Google Maps in iOS 6, but another of the web giant’s biggest properties won’t be available as a default option, either. 9to5Mac noticed that the latest beta version of iOS 6 no longer includes the long-standard YouTube app, and Apple just told us that its license to include YouTube in iOS had expired. If you’re a heavy YouTube user, fear not — Apple also confirmed that YouTube will work in Safari and also noted that Google is making a new YouTube app that will be available in the App Store.

Not surprising given that Apple is dropping Google Maps in iOS 6 as well..
