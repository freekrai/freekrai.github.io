[Hook.js](http://usehook.com/) allows you to add “pull to refresh” functionality to your websites and web apps, just like many mobile apps use. Your users just have to scroll a bit and they’ll get a refreshed page. It’s beautifully implemented and works wonderfully. It’s a great option for your user interfaces.
