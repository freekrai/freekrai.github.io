Steve Ballmer:

> How many of us have gone to a meeting with somebody who brought a tablet and then when it comes time to actually take notes, writes them down on pencil and paper. Or can’t get at the spreadsheet…or try to use it in terminal emulator mode…or take [a long time] to set up and turn their tablet into something that approximates a PC.

Umm, maybe if you’ve ever seen that happen it’s because they were using a Surface?

Seriously, most tablet owners are smart enough about how to use their devices to do what they need to.

Ballmer would like his customers to believe what he’s saying, because if he can get them to buy into the idea that tablets are just too hard to use in meetings, perhaps the Surface, which runs Windows and MS Office, will sell better.
