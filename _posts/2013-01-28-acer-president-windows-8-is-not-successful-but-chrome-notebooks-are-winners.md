> Count Acer as being disillusioned with Windows 8, but seeing a future in Chrome. President Jim Wong says that Windows 8 “is still not successful,” while touting the benefits of Chrome notebooks, which he says already account for between 5 percent and 10 percent of Acer’s U.S. sales.
> 
> That’s what Wong told Bloomberg in an interview. He said:
> 
> > “Windows 8 itself is still not successful. The whole market didn’t come back to growth after the Windows 8 launch, that’s a simple way to judge if it is successful or not.”
> 
> To make up for the disappointing sales of Windows 8 devices, Acer is looking elsewhere. And right now, it’s finding that Chrome has been surprisingly successful. Acer released Chrome notebooks for $199 in November, and Chrome now accounts for between 5 percent and 10 percent of Acer’s U.S. sales. It’s been so successful that Acer may roll it out to other developed markets.

One thing I can see Windows 8 doing.. driving more people to pick up Chromebooks instead…
