David Sparks:

> There was a bit of surprising news today out of [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/) from Matthew Panzarino. It looks like Apple bought [Workflow](https://workflow.is), which is–in my opinion–the single most useful utility application on the iPhone or iPad. I love Workflow so much that I made a [MacSparky Video Field Guide](https://www.macsparky.com/workflowapp) about it.

> Workflow is an application that allows you to glue together other applications on iOS and create automated tasks. For instance, [I use a Workflow recipe](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/6/screencast-and-workflow-automating-pdfs-on-iphone-and-ipad) to automatically date and file PDF documents on my iPad. Once I figured it out, the process is actually faster on my iPad then it is on my Mac.

> I once made a joke on Mac Power Users that the only reason Workflow got approved was because someone must have naked pictures of somebody important at Apple. The application seemed just so contrary to Apple's general position of iOS simplicity. (Not that I'm complaining.) Over the years, the Workflow team has continued to innovate with this application, adding new features often and allowing us to automate work on the iPad and iPhone that we only dreamed about just a few years ago.

> Frankly, I'm mixed about the idea of Apple purchasing Workflow

David makes excellent points in this post. I've been using Workflow since day 1 and love it, so am anxious to see how this turns out.
