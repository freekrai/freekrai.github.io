Emil Protalinsk, writing for The Next Web:

> Reports are coming in of a Tumblr worm spreading on the microblogging platform. Among the victims are [The Verge](http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/)‘s and [CNET](http://cnet.tumblr.com/)‘s Tumblrs, which include a message about a ‘GNAA video’ post. It’s advisable for users to avoid visiting Tumblr blogs directly until the issue is resolved, and definitely not to click on any GNAA posts with a video inside nor accompanying links.

> “There is a viral post circulating on Tumblr which begins “Dearest ‘Tumblr’ users”,” a Tumblr spokesperson said in a statement. “If you have viewed this post, please log out of all browsers that may be using Tumblr immediately. Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as swiftly as possible. Thank you.”

I remember when something similar hit Twitter a couple years ago..
