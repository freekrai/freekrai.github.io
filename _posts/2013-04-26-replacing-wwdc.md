Nice piece from Marco on what Apple should consider doing with WWDC…

> Every year, Apple tries to address the excessive demand for WWDC in new ways.
> 
>  They already make the WWDC videos available promptly after the conference to all registered developers — and every year, they come out faster. They already periodically send the small Developer Evangelism team around the world doing small “Tech Talks” (free, one-day mini-WWDCs, effectively), and they give attendance priority to people who haven’t attended WWDC.
> 
>  It hasn’t helped.
