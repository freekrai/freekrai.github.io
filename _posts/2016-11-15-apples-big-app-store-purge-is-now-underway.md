Sarah Perez, reporting for TechCrunch:

> Earlier this year, [Apple promised it would clean up its iOS App Store](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/apple-is-going-to-remove-abandoned-apps-from-the-app-store/) by removing outdated, abandoned apps, including those that no longer meet current guidelines or don’t function as intended. That great App Store purge now appears to be underway, according to new data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The company found that app removals increased by 238 percent in October 2016, with mobile games seeing the most deletions.
> 
> Apple had originally stated that the deadline for developers who wanted their outdated apps spared was September 7, 2016. However, Apple didn’t take immediate action during the month in terms of large-scale removals.
> 
> That seems to have changed in October, when 47,300 apps were removed from the App Store, Sensor Tower discovered.
