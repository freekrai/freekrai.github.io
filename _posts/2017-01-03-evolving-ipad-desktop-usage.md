The Brooks Review:

> It has been over a year of full time iPad usage for me, and in that year I have had my iPad in a plethora of configurations. From the simple Smart Keyboard Cover to nearly duct taping it to the wall. What I have come to realize over this past year, is how portable and manageable the iPad as a desktop machine is.

It's always interesting to see how others manage to use their iPad full-time. 

I love my iPad, and use it every day. I've even used it as my primary workstation. I can almost make it my full-time machine jut not quite there fully yet.
