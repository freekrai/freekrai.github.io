Marco Arment:

> The iPad Mini is a conflicted product.
> 
> It’s *much* better than the iPad 3 and 4 to handle, carry, and hold up during use. It has the best external design of any iPad to date. It runs cooler than the iPad 3 or 4, it has almost the same battery life despite its much smaller size and weight, and it matches the iPad 2 and 3 in most performance benchmarks. It charges more quickly than the iPad 3 or 4, and it’s more versatile in charging, since it’s the first iPad able to charge at full speed from an “iPhone” AC adapter. The Smart Cover even sticks to the back better when it’s flipped around.
> 
> And, of course, it’s much cheaper than the other iPads.
> 
> But the non-Retina screen is *rough*. If you’ve never used a Retina-screened device, you probably won’t care, but if you’ve been [spoiled](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/11/12/winer-ipad-mini/) by Retina, you’ll notice the lack of it in the Mini almost every time you turn it on. I stop noticing after I start doing something with it, of course, but those first few seconds are a rough reminder every time.
