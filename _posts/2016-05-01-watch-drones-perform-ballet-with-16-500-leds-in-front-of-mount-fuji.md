> Japan has some fairly strict drone regulations that bar private pilots from flying the devices in public parks, but that hasn't stopped a fleet of the remote controlled vehicles from taking to the skies to perform a "ballet" accompanied by traditional Japanese shamisen music, set against the beautiful backdrop of Mount Fuji. 
> 
> The performance was produced by Japanese company MicroAd, which used more than 20 of its LED-encrusted Sky Magic drones to fly in formation with the music, their 16,500 lights twinkling in the dusk gloom.
