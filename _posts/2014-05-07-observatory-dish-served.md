The NRC radio observatory is about 20 minutes from were we live. I have several friends who work out there, including a couple who worked on this repair project.

> The National Research Council’s dish that was [damaged during transportation](http://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/100769/300K-telescope-damaged-in-flight) last year, was mounted on a tower at the observatory on White Lake Road on Wednesday.
> 
> The $300,000 carbon fibre dish was lifted using a crane and plenty of manpower, as an enthusiastic crowd looked on.
> 
> “This is a perfect day,” said Gary Hovey, project manager for the SKA dish verification project. “We are excited we were able to repair the dish, within three days it popped back.”
> 
> Wednesday’s effort entailed a crane with a harness that had specific links hooking on to six connecting points on the 8.7 tonne dish.
> 
> It was then lifted on to the tower. The next step will be to measure it and see how it performs regarding wind, gravity and temperature.
> 
> The dish was dented while being transported via helicopter from Okanagan Falls to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory on Oct. 17, 2013.

And if you want to see how the dish got damaged in the first place, someone took a video of it in flight that showed the damage happening…
