Anil Dash:

> We have some tough news: We’re going to be shutting down the ThinkUp service on July 18 and issuing a refund then for the balance of all member subscriptions. There have been significant changes from Instagram, Twitter and Facebook that make it too hard for us to keep the service running, especially since we’ve been struggling as a business. We’re sorry, and we’re going to try to handle this shutdown the right way.

That's too bad that they're shutting down, I really liked ThinkUp, I used to use their original open source solution and it worked nicely, But with all the changes coming to the APIs, I can certainly understand the decision.
