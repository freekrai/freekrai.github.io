> Walk into any Apple Retail Store when it opens in the morning and you might notice that all of the new MacBook Pro notebooks with retina display are positioned at exactly the same angle. Employees who open the store use an iPhone app as a level to tilt all the screens to exactly the same angle

Interesting read on how Apple Stores like to get you to try a MacBook or iPad.. Ingenious that they purposely tilt their MacBook screens in such a way that you want to touch and adjust them.. Then you get hooked..
