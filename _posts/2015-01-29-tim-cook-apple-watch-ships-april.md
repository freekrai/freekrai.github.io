Ars Technica:

> Apple CEO Tim Cook dropped a rare bit of product news on the company’s Q1 2015 earnings call: the Apple Watch begins shipping in April.
> 
>  The Apple Watch will start at $349 for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model, though starting prices for the more expensive stainless steel and gold models haven’t yet been revealed.

About the time frame that was expected.

As we get closer to a sales date, I find it interesting how many people are at least interested in seeing the Apple Watch.
