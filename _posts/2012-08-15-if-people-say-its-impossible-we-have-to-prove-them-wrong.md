[The Invisible Bicycle Helmet | Fredrik Gertten](http://vimeo.com/43038579) from [Focus Forward Films](http://vimeo.com/focusf) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

> Design students Anna and Terese took on a giant challenge as an exam project. Something no one had done before. If they could swing it, it would for sure be revolutionary. The bicycle is a tool to change the world. If we use bikes AND travel safe: Life will be better for all.

Fairly interesting story of a couple of design students in Sweden who took an idea and turned into an interesting looking product..
