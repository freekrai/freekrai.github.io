If you want a workstation that help turn your iPad into a more robust writing machine, the [ZAGGfolio](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005C2A4DO/phpprof-20) is a good tool to look at.

It has a built-in Bluetooth keyboard, and a snap-top cover that integrates with your iPad.

If you do a lot of typing and want to do more of it on your iPad, or you want a better typing alternative to the iPadâ€™s touch screen, then this too may be a great accessory.

*I also have this same case for my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and find it extremely handy to have.*
