Peter Bright reviews Windows Phone 8.1 for Ars Technica:

> Windows Phone 8.1, therefore, has a lot of work to do. It needs to take further steps along the path toward Microsoft’s vision of a unified operating system. It needs to work better on a wider range of hardware to both strengthen its position at the low end and give it a chance of making inroads at the high end. It needs to also offer *features*: it needs to do things to get people talking about the platform while attracting both users and developers.
> 
> Remarkably, Windows Phone 8.1 delivers on all fronts.
