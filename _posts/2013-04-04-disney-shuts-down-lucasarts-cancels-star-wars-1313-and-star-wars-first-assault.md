> Staff were informed of the shutdown this morning, according to a reliable Kotaku source. Some 150 people were laid off, and both of the studio’s current projects—Star Wars: First Assault and Star Wars 1313—were cancelled. Disney will still use the LucasArts name to license games, but the studio is no more.

I was a fan of the LucasArts games since the 90s so this is sad news.. But no surprise following the 2012 acquisition of LucasArts by the Walt Disney Company in October of 2012 when Disney acquired Lucasfilm.
