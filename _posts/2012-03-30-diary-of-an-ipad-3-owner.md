Shawn Blanc recently posted this chronicle of using the new iPad, starting when he sat down with a coffee to watch the live blog of the announcement to a week after he got it, and how the process went of syncing, developing a work flow, and generally what he thinks of it over the iPad 2.. Interesting, honest read.
