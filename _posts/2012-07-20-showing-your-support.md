Marco Arment:

> If you want to keep the software and services around that you enjoy, do what you can to make their businesses successful enough that it’s more attractive to keep running them than to be hired by a big tech company.

I agree with Marco. I share the same opinion with my own projects and don’t hesitate to show my support for software and services I enjoy.

**Update:** Marco [posted a followup to this post](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/21/followup-talent-acquisitions) over the weekend that had some good points as well.
