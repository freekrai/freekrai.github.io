Sebastiaan de With:

> Designing the app was difficult. It wasn’t just difficult for the obvious reasons, like implementation details, aesthetic preferences, and because you want to add more and more to an application as you go along designing it, but also because Android is simply a really hard platform to design for.

[doubleTwist Alarm ](http://www.doubletwist.com/alarmclock/) is a nice, beautiful looking alarm clock app for Android, and it’s nice reading about the design process to make this nice-looking app.
