Macworld has compiled a roster of Apple’s various platforms used over the years, starting with the Apple I in 1976 and and closing with the present day iOS. Fans will recognize key efforts in the company’s catalog — such as the Macintosh and Lisa — but there are a few wildcards. The TechStep, for example, was designed to be used as a diagnostic tool, while the Apple-branded Pippin was manufactured and sold by Bandai as an entertainment computer that could also play games. If you need to brush up on the history of Apple’s hardware and platforms, then look no further.

> If you asked someone to name Apple’s computer platforms, you’d probably get three answers: Apple II, Mac, and iOS. But the true history of Apple’s computing platform heritage is much more rich and varied than most people realize.

> Over the past 36 years, Apple has created at least 13 distinct platforms, each hosting its own unique variety of software. Some of these surprisingly forgotten ecosystems met quick deaths at the hands of an unforgiving market, while others persist under our noses in the consumer electronics sector.
