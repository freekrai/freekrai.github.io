Stephen Hackett:

> With Office for iPad being released this week and Microsoft reportedly backing away from its anti-iPad campaign, change is underway at the software giant.
> 
> There’s an obvious reason for this. The company’s new CEO Satya Nadella is[ a breath of fresh air in Redmond](http://live.theverge.com/satya-nadella-press-conference-liveblog/).
> 
> Clearly Office for iPad was in the works before Nadella was promoted to CEO in February. There’s evidence of Office for iPad that surfaced (hrm!) back in October 2013 and December of 2012. Eric Slivka’s Mac Rumors post in October suggests that Microsoft was working on bringing a “touch-first” version of Office to its own Windows platform before iOS.

> It’s not hard to imagine the meeting where Steve Ballmer was shown the product and forbid it to be released.

> And there — right there — is why Nadella is different from his predecessor.

> But to see just how different he is from Ballmer, it’s important to look at the past.

I agree with Hackett on this, Nadella might just be who Microsoft needs at the helm to stay relevant…
