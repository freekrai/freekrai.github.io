Google’s Senior Mobile VP Andy Rubin has been cool towards tablet apps, arguing that mobile titles shouldn’t be tuned to a specific form factor.  
 Whether you agree with that assessment or not, his company has produced an (arguably overdue) tablet app checklist to help developers with big screen ambitions.

The step-by-step walkthrough tells developers how to make the most of all that free space and optimize for the larger hardware, touch input targets and widgets. There’s a difference between having guidelines and getting app writers to follow them, but the checklist is an important step towards keeping that Galaxy Note 10.1 or Nexus 7 well-fed.

> To help you take advantage of the opportunity provided by the growing tablet market, we’ve put together this Tablet App Quality Checklist to make it easier for you to ensure your app meets the expectations of tablet users.
> 
> The checklist includes a number of key focus areas for building apps that are a great experience on tablets, including:
> 
> - Optimizing your layouts for larger screens
> - Taking advantage of extra screen area available on tablets
> - Using Icons and other assets that are designed for tablet screens
