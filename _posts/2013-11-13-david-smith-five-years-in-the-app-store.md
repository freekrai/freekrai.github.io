>  My experience with iOS (then iPhone OS) had begun the preceding March when Apple had released the first SDK for the nascent iPhone platform. At the time I didn’t have an iPhone. I had no experience with developing for Apple platforms. I was a Ruby-on-Rails/Flash developer for the Rosetta Stone. I don’t recall exactly where I heard about the SDK, but I do remember immediately having the feeling that this would be something big.
