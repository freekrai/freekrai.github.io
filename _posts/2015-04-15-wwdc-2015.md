Anybody notice the center of this year's WWDC logo looks a lot like an Apple TV?

That, plus the slogan — “The Epicenter of Change” — would fit with an expanded HomeKit role for Apple TV, and the expected speculation of an Apple TV update this year after the price drop last month.

For attendees, it’s a lottery again (and likely will remain so for the foreseeable future — the last time they simply sold passes they sold out in one minute). Interesting, but not surprising: [to apply for a student scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/), you have to submit an app that is at least partially written using Swift.
