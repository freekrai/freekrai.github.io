David Smith:

> Yesterday Instagram [announced](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/12/17/instagram-tos) a change in their terms of service that makes me worry about how they plan to use the images I’ve posted to their service moving forward. This seems the inevitable result of Facebook’s acquisition of the service back in April.
> 
> When the Facebook acquisition was first announced I [created](http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/04/09/instabackup-get-your-images-out-of-instagram/) a simple Mac utility, [InstaBackup](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instabackup/id518000330?mt=12&partnerId=30&siteID=IzE7m699rYo-kZGOJCGdiJS7BwDyWZ7k6A), that lets you export your Instagram catalog. You could use this for simply backup purposes. However, the uncertainty the Terms of Service change creates has caused a lot of people to start using this for pulling all their pictures from Instagram before deleting their account.

In light of [yesterday’s change](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57559710-38/instagram-says-it-now-has-the-right-to-sell-your-photos/)s, I’ve already moved my photos off Instagram..
