To John’s credit, he allowed for the possibility that this is a perception problem but ultimately concluded otherwise because “no one else seems to be disagreeing”. I disagree.

Even if you dismiss this as a lagging indicator what you cannot dismiss is that customer satisfaction remains at an all-time high. More importantly, actual usage of Apple’s products and services continues unabated, something you would not expect if Apple’s software quality were truly declining.

It’s almost impossible to build a set of tests that mirror all possible configurations. What works when you are a niche player does not work when you are one of the biggest companies in the world. In short, Apple is the victim of its own success.

Dave hits several points on the head in this post, for Apple, it's perception. Look at how well your iPhone or iPad or your mac computers run...

There is no doubt that there are actual problems. Several bugs become widely known and persist for years. 

But the problem with complexity is that you get long lists of fixes for no-doubt weary and overworked software teams at Apple. 

So, just ask yourself this: Would you rather be using Windows? Or an Android phone? 

That answer is a no contest knockdown winner.
