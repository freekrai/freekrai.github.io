> Developers should have the freedom to focus on innovating for their customers, not spending time worrying about handling the complex task of payments. As one of the largest, most trusted online payments service around the globe, nobody can grow with a developer’s business the way that PayPal can. We connect 123 million account holders across more than 50 financial networks in 190 markets and in 25 currencies around the world. And, we do it securely so that developers don’t need to worry about managing complex issues like fraud or all of the compliance requirements.

> But we listened when our developers said they wanted better capabilities from us, and now we’re doubling down on our developer programs to deliver the best tools in the industry

PayPal just announced some updates to its developer options today that include launching a mobile SDK that will let app makers build in PayPal payment. Starting on iOS and expanding later to Android, users will be able to make purchases directly through apps, either by entering information through a PayPal form or by scanning a credit card through [camera-based payment tool Card.io](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/17/3165825/paypal-card-io-optical-mobile-payment). In cases involving subscriptions or in-app goods, that could mean payments are subject to Apple’s 30 percent fee; in other cases — like apps selling physical goods — they would likely be exempt.

PayPal has also created a simpler JavaScript button that can be added by copying five lines of code, and it’s launching new beta APIs based on more modern security and processing standards, as well as a central site for development resources.
