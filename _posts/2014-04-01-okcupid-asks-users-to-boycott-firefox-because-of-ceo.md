> Anyone accessing the popular dating site OKCupid with Firefox today is in for a surprise. Instead of the homepage, [OKCupid.com ](https://www.okcupid.com/)is serving Firefox users with a message calling out Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich for his support of California’s Proposition 8, highlighted by a $1000 donation made in 2008. “Mozilla’s new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal rights for gay couples,” the message tells users. “We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access OkCupid.”
