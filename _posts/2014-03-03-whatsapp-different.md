Interesting breakdown by Om Malik, of WhatsApp vs Facebook by the numbers…

> It has been over a week since Facebook [announced its intentions to buy](http://gigaom.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-acquire-whatsapp-for-19b/) Whatsapp for about $19 billion (all told.) The news obviously generated a lot of debate and a lot of commentary filled the airwaves. The stock market more or less approved of the deal, giving Facebook stock and market capitalization the requisite bump it needed. [I argued that it was an irrationally rational deal.](http://gigaom.com/2014/02/19/the-irrational-rationality-behind-facebooks-16-billion-acquisition-of-whatsapp/)

> [Since I started a new gig](http://www.trueventures.com/2014/02/20/om-joins-true-full-time/), I sort of ignored most of the published commentary. A couple of days ago in a conversation with my new colleague at [True Ventures](http://trueventures.com/),[Keila Fong](http://about.me/keila), we started talking about how different really is Whatsapp that it is worth $19 billion to Mark Zuckerberg. So we ran some numbers and compared Whatsapp’s numbers to some of the other social applications.
