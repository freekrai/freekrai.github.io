Amazon Web Services has made an acquisition to continue building out the services that it offers around and on its cloud storage platform. It has bought [Cloud9](https://c9.io), a San Francisco-based startup that has built an integrated development environment (IDE) for web and mobile developers to collaborate together.

[Cloud9 itself](https://c9.io/blog/great-news/) made the news public today in a statement on its site, which also says that the company will continue to offer its existing service while it also works on building new tools for AWS.

> “We’re excited to let you, our users and customers, be among the first to learn that we have been acquired by Amazon! We will be joining the Amazon Web Services family, and we’re looking forward to working together on terrific customer offerings for the future,” co-founder Reuben Daniels writes. “In the meantime, you’ll still be able to depend on and continue to invest safely in Cloud9. It’s still business as usual—we’ll continue to work with our Ace Open Source community and to provide our innovative services to you and our hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide. Over time, we’ll work with AWS to do even more on your behalf.”

Founded in 2010, today Cloud9 supports some 40 different programming languages and lets remote teams work together to develop and edit code (with an option of using its online code editor or an Ubuntu workspace) and then test that code across some 300 different combinations of browsers and operating systems.

I actually use Cloud9 heavily via the self-hosted platform, with it running on a Digital Ocean server and works great between macbook, iPad or chromebook.
