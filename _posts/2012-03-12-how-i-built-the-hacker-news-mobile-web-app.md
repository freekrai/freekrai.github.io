> Last month, I tweeted about one of my recent projects, the Hacker News mobile web app. It’s a simple little app to  
>  read Hacker News’ stories and comments in Mobile Safari. It started out as an experiment for me to try one of the  
>  new CSS extensions introduced in Mobile Safari in iOS5, -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch which uses native-style  
>  scrolling in an overflow: scroll element.
