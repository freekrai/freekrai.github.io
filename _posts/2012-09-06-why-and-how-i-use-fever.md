After my post yesterday about quitting [Google Reader for Fever](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/09/05/good-bye-google-reader), today I came across this post on the same topic from Anthony Drendel, the developer of the [Sunstroke app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id488564806) for reading Fever on the iPhone.

I have to agree with him on the reasons for using Fever, as opposed to other RSS readers.

One thing he left out about Fever is that it’s great if you don’t like to waste time keeping up with news while you are away — just set the Hot List for the last week (or whatever time frame) and you can get a great sense of what happened while you were away.
