Google vs. Samsung

Horace Dediu on Samsung’s booming profits:

> All this plus an overall growth in volumes from 64 million to over 100 million per quarter has meant that the company is raking in enormous profits. Not only did it overtake Nokia, the market share leader for 14 years, but is making more profits than Nokia ever did.
> 
> So much profit in fact that it has overtaken Google’s decisively.
> 
> The reason I point this out is that Samsung’s success is dependent on having ridden on the back of Android. Samsung’s ascent can be precisely timed to their adoption of Android.
