> Following Yahoo’s September [announcement](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/yahoo-confirms-state-sponsored-attacker-stole-personal-data-of-at-least-500-million-users/) of a data breach affecting 500 million user accounts, the company has made it more difficult for Yahoo Mail users to transition to another email service. At the beginning of October, Yahoo disabled an email forwarding feature, which would allow users to automatically redirect incoming emails sent to their Yahoo address to another account.

> In other words, Yahoo Mail users who had already set up forwarding won’t be affected, but anyone trying to forward their mail now won’t have the option.

Why are people still on Yahoo mail?
