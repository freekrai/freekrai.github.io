**Update please read bottom of post**

24 hours after being posted for sale, google has switched the 16 gig nexus 7 tablets to being unavailable…

Apparently pre-order stock has sold out and I guess it’s just a matter of time til the 8 gigs are also sold out.

***Update** my contact at google just informed me that it’s not in fact sold out but a bug in their Canadian shopping system and will be back for pre-order within the hour..*
