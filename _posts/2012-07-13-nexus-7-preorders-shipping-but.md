In a case of disorganization, Google has begun shipping Nexus 7 tablets, on the same day that some retailers have begun selling them…

Normally, the whole point of pre-orders is that you have your device on launch day or earlier, but in this case, tablets have only now begun to ship, while you can go to your nearest Staples, GameStop, Office Depot or other retailers that carry them and pick one up..

On another note, retailers are only selling the 16gig unit, so if you want an 8gig, you have to deal with google play.

**FYI:** anyone in Canada who has a nexus 7 before the cases are actually available.. Just about any Kindle Fire case will fit nicely..

*And yes, I realize how dumb it is that we can buy Kindle Fire cases everywhere but we can’t buy Kindle Fires in Canada.*
