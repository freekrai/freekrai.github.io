Michael Tsai:

> These days, your Apple ID is the master key to all sorts of personal information and privileges, including the ability to remote wipe iOS devices and access your Mac, even if you didn’t share your FileVault 2 recovery key with Apple. It doesn’t seem prudent to share it with anyone.

This isn’t that different than third-party email clients, and I can’t see Apple preventing you from accessing your iCloud email from a third-party email client…

There should definitely be a better solution to this though… I’m a little wary of sending my Apple ID credentials to any third party.
