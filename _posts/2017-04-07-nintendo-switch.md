[![The Nintendo Switch](/media/switch.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2paxTiy)

I had started to write my review of the [Nintendo Switch](http://amzn.to/2paxTiy), but Myke Hurley did a great job pulling together this video walkthrough of it, and nailed just about everything I had planned to write, so I'm sharing it here.

If you are interested in the [Nintendo Switch](http://amzn.to/2paxTiy), then you need to watch this video.

The [Nintendo Switch](http://amzn.to/2paxTiy) is an interesting take on console gaming, play it plugged into your TV or grab it and take it on the go.

The Switch blurs the line between home and portable gaming, which makes what it can do more powerful.

As far as game play and graphics go, for what is essentially a tablet, this is a nice package.

As more games come out, it will be an even better experience but as far as current game play goes, Zelda is a great game right now.
