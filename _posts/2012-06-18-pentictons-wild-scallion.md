This article came out back in January, but I thought I’d link to it now since the Wild Scallion is one of our favourite restuarants to eat at here in town.

The food is an asian fushion that feels home cooked.. And tastes so good..

Their $10 dollar dinner boxes consisting of Gabbage Salad which spicy Lime Garlic dressing, rice, and teriyaki chicken are delicious and won’t hurt the wallet either.

The tandoori lima beans and chick peas also make a good vegetarian option and the salad rolls are a tasty snack.

Definitely recommend for anyone in the area looking for a quick healthy place to eat.
