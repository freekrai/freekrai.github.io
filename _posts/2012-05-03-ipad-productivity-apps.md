An interesting look at how others use their iPads…

> I’m very invested in the iPad as a laptop replacement, and I endeavour to make it my main machine when I’m away from my desk (at which I currently use an iMac). I travel regularly, often to speak at events, and I try to embrace simplicity and to work away from my office as much as I can.
> 
> To that end, I’ve compiled a list of my essential iPad applications for productivity, that I use regularly when:
> 
> - Planning and thinking about projects (in my case, often software).
> - Writing (for this blog, for Tap! magazine, and others).
> - Creating documentation and reports (for clients, based on my User Experience and Accessibility consulting services).
> - Creating and refining presentations for my speaking engagements.
> 
> Since I have my iPhone with me at all times, I try to keep only essential “big screen” apps on my iPad. For example, I keep my various apps for package-tracking, flight information, reminders etc strictly on the phone.
