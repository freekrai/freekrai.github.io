Patrick Rhone:

> If you are not a very, very, very, patient, friendly, likable and kind people-person you probably should not be in this line of work. I’ve seen tons of consultants who quite obviously would have been happier if they had never shaved their neck beard and ventured out of their mother’s basement. If that is you, please take up some line of business that keeps you in the basement. You have to be a person who honestly likes dealing with people that are clueless when it comes to this stuff. Your thrill has to come from giving these people “lightbulb moments”.

Also, really good follow-up by [Stephen Hackett](http://512pixels.net/2013/04/on-being-a-mac-consultant/) (a [former](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/bartending-by-stephen-hackett-shows-the-human-side-of-apple-retail/) Genius himself):

> We did a fair amount of consulting, and the most important thing I told people was this: “I don’t know, but I know how to find out.”
