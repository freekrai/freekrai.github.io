Marco Arment:

> A big question is whether Twitter will even give third-party apps the chance to display their “consistent experience” before cutting them off. I’m guessing they won’t.

This is a follow up from Marco Arment related to the [post](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/08/01/the-future-of-twitter-s-platform-is-all-in-the-cards) I mentioned a few days ago…

Like I said then, Twitter’s API changes are going to be interesting and has most developers wo rely on it in a state of flux right now as we wait and see where Twitter will decide to go.
