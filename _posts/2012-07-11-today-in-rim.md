Ben Brooks on the news from RIM today:

> Lots of good stuff floating around the web today about RIM, no doubt because they held their annual shareholders meeting.
> 
> There are four specific articles that I think need to be called out for their interconnectedness alone.

I want to like the company, I have friends who have worked there for years, and I was a blackberry user for years as well.

So hopefully, they can get their stuff together and pull out of the spiral theyâ€™ve been in the last couple years.
