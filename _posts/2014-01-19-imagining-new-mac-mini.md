Peter Cohen:

> The Mac mini is overdue for a major refresh. It’s been well more than a year, and it’s been several years since the Mac mini had any significant work done to it. That’s got me thinking about what Apple could do it and probably should do to it.

I think it will be interesting to see what Apple does with the Mac Mini…

We’ve seen a refresh of the iPhone, iPad, MacBooks and Mac Pro recently.. What could be next for the Mac Mini?
