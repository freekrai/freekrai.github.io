My daughter has a small cold right now, which means I have to make her special honey lemon tea drink for her sore throat:

**Ingredients**

- 1 cup water
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste

**Directions**

1. Pour water into a mug
2. Add honey and heat in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
3. Stir in lemon juice, mixing until honey is dissolved, then stir in the sugar.
