> Feedbin [launched](http://blog.feedbin.me/2013/03/12/rediscover-rss/) into a market with no future. Google owned RSS and they had let it languish.
> 
> That all changed when Google [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) they were shutting down Google Reader two days after Feedbin launched.
> 
> I built Feedbin because I still loved RSS but I didn’t like Google Reader. It looked like it had been abandoned after the [last update in 2011](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html) that attempted to prop up Google+ by removing many features.
> 
> The goal was to be able to cover costs in one year. Instead it took three weeks. It cost about $170/month to run Feedbin when it launched and with $1.62/user/month in profit after credit card fees it looked like I would need just over 100 customers who were also looking for a Google Reader alternative.
> 
> Feedbin has one of those boring business models that actually works. Charging money for a good or service. Feedbin will never have millions of customers but that’s OK. It just needs you.
> 
> Timing was everything for Feedbin’s success. I think having a halfway decent product only went so far as to not actively *hurt *Feedbin’s chances. Of course Google Reader closing was the event that started it all, but gaining [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) support early on gave Feedbin a built in audience.

RSS isn’t dead, it’s just entering a rebirth.

I like Fedbin, I used their service when they first launched, but then moved over to [Feed Wrangler](http://feedwrangler.net), where I’ve been ever since. That has nothing on Feedbin, I just liked Feed Wrangler a little better :)
