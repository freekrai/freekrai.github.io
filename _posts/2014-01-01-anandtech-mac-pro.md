Following on the heels of the [iFixit Mac Pro review](http://rogerstringer.com/2013/12/31/the-ifixit-mac-pro-teardown/ "The iFixit Mac Pro Teardown"), AnandTech has just posted theirs:

> The last Mac Pro I reviewed was in 2010. Little had changed externally since the PowerMac G5 I bought years ago. I lamented the chassis’ lack of support for 2.5” drives. A year later I abandoned the Mac Pro entirely for a Sandy Bridge MacBook Pro. I was a late adopter for the notebook as a desktop usage model, but a lack of progress on the Mac Pro drove me away from the design.
