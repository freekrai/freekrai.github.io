[Five months ago](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3932850/blackberry-plans-to-upgrade-all-existing-playbooks-to-BB10), BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins promised: “Our plan is to upgrade all existing PlayBooks to BlackBerry 10.”

[Last Friday](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/28/4473888/blackberry-playbook-will-not-be-upgraded-to-blackberry-10):

> BlackBerry has just announced that it will not, in fact, be upgrading the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet to its latest mobile OS, BlackBerry 10. CEO Thorsten Heins revealed the sour news on the company’s investor call relating to today’s earnings report, though he didn’t delve into the specifics of why the company’s plans have changed. The only justification offered by Heins is that BlackBerry was unable to get performance up to a satisfactory level, and the company now intends to focus on core products instead.

The PlayBook has been one mistake after another.. The latest, promising to upgrade Playbooks to BlackBerry 10, and then saying that the Playbook didn’t sell well enough to warrant the new OS.. is just the final nail on the coffin..
