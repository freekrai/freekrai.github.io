Major changes in Version 4. Some highlights:

* Moved to Sass from LESS
* Improved version of box-sizing as part of their new reset.
* Opt-in (single variable toggle) to use flexbox on the grids/components.
* Type set mostly in rems
* All JavaScript in ES6

And another big move for them: monitization through <a href="http://themes.getbootstrap.com/">purchaseable themes</a> designed by Bootstrap team themselves.
