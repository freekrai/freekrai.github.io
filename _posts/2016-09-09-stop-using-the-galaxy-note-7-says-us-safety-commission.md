> The US plans to formally recall the Galaxy Note 7 and is telling consumers to power down and cease charging the phones immediately.
> 
> The recommendation came through a US Consumer Product Safety Commission [statement today](http://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/Press-Statements/Press-Statement-from-the-US-Consumer-Product-Safety-Commission-Regarding-the-Samsung-Galaxy-Note7/), which referenced the [various fires](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12855352/samsung-note-7-recall-fires) that have been linked to battery issues with Samsung's new phone. "These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note 7s," the commission writes.

> It put the recommendation more bluntly in a tweet:

All the pundits who are busy claiming that everything Apple is doing right now was done years ago by Samsung (or others), need to remember this phone.
