> I publish articles in exactly two places: here on this blog, and in magazines (both digital and paper). In the latter case, the pieces are paid commissions. Sometimes I’ll republish my own commissioned articles here, and sometimes I accept requests to republish my blog articles elsewhere, but generally speaking a piece is either exclusively here, or exclusively elsewhere.

Matt Gemmell has an interesting piece explaining why he doesn’t post on sites like Medium and instead writes for his own site.

I’ve written on Medium, but not for a while, I’ve instead been focusing on this blog or my other sites lately.
