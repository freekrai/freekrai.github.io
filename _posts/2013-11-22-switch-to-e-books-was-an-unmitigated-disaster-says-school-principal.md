Denise Calnan, reporting for Independent.ie:

> The ‘book to e-book’ move was deemed a disaster following major technical issues with the majority of the HP Elite Pad tablet devices. […]
> 
> “The HP Elite Pad has proved to be an unmitigated disaster. We have met with HP representatives on a number of occasions to address the issues. To ensure stability and continuity of education I have ordered a full set of books for all the students.”
> 
> Students experienced problems such as tablets failing to switch on, tablets spontaneously going into sleep mode, devices looping while performing automatic repairs, system board failures and issues with wi-fi.
> 
> Principal Gleeson said it was “an informed decision” to choose the HP Elite tablet. “A year and a half’s worth of research was put into choosing the right device for us.”

You spent a year and a half researching tablets and the HP Elite is what you choose as your best choice?

Local stores here have been continually having to lower the prices of the Elite in order to convince people to buy them. There would have been so many better choices than this…
