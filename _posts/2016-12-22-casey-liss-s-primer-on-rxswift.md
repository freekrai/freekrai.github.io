Casey has written a pretty interesting 5 part series to serve as a primer on RxSwift.

In the five parts he's covered:

1.  [What x is all about](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/12/15/rxswift-primer-part-1)
2.   [How to convert a simple sample app to use Rx](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/12/16/rxswift-primer-part-2)
3.   [Eliminated stored state](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/12/19/rxswift-primer-part-3)
4.   [Learned how to use a RxCocoa unit](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/12/20/rxswift-primer-part-4)
5.   [Learned how to implement unit testing](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/12/21/rxswift-primer-part-5)

These five articles give you a good place to start on RxSwift.
