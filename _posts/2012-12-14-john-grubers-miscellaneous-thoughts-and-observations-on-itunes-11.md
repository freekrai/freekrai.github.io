John Gruber:

> There are redesigns and there are redesigns. This one’s the real deal. It’s not a rewrite though. Clearly, in its heart, under the hood, this is still the same iTunes. It’s what you see (at least in the main window; see below) that’s all new. That’s not a complaint, and it shouldn’t be surprising. iTunes 11 still does — at least as far as I can tell — everything that iTunes 10 did. Apple has addressed the biggest problem with iTunes 10: its presentation was severely cluttered.

I’ve found iTunes 11 to be interesting. There are lots of little UI things that are annoying when you look for them, such as buttons not following their styles everywhere, but otherwise, it’s an improvement over iTunes 10 by far.
