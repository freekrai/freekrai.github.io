Adrianne Jeffries at The Verge has a great interview up with Markus Spiering, the service’s lead at Yahoo. In it, he says:

> The end goal for the platform is to provide users with the possibility that, as long as they have their photos on Flickr, their photos are everywhere.

That’s a pretty bold goal, but one I like. I hope they can pull it off.
