Excellent article from Jason Fried:

> Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesnt involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. Thats easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea. *UPDATE: Good follow-up rule of thumb from [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is/three-questions).*
