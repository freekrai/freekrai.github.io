I’m a long time listener of the Talk Show, as well as most of the other shows on the 5by5 network. So I was surprised last week to find the Talk Show had moved from the 5by5 network to Mule radio and wondered what happened, as the show seemed to go from a two person show to a one host / one guest format.

Dan’s quick 5 minute talk about the move was both classy and informative as he explained without going in to too much detail what had happened to the show.

Might be looking at other podcasts to fill that void now, as I haven’t decided if I want to stay a listener on the new show just yet.
