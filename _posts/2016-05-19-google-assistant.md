[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/18/google-io-2016):

> Google is clearly the best at this voice-driven assistant stuff. Pichai claimed that in their own competitive analysis, Google Assistant is “an order of magnitude” ahead of competing assistants (read: Siri and Alexa). That sounds about right. This might be like Steve Jobs’s 2007 claim that the iPhone was “5 years” ahead of anyone else.

> Only Google has the expertise in web services and the massive amount of data to keep going beyond basic questions. I expect both Siri and Alexa will hit brick walls that Google will get past, especially in conversational queries that let the user drill down below the most popular, superficial facts.

[Caitlin McGarry](http://www.macworld.com/article/3072452/software/google-assistant-makes-it-clear-that-siri-is-seriously-behind.html):

> It’s a problem that could be solved with a Siri API for app developers, but according to a recent [Reuters report](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-privacy-insight-idUSKCN0WN0BO), Apple’s Siri shortcomings can be attributed to the company’s stance on privacy.

> The company has a trio of so-called “privacy czars” who vet every decision, even inspecting lines of code that might violate laws or company standards. When Apple bought Siri five years ago, it was decided that data on what you ask Siri would be stored separately from personal data, so Siri lacks a lot of the knowledge about you that it would need to be a truly useful assistant.

[Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2016/googles-go-to-market-gap/):

> The net result is that Google has no choice but to put its founding proposition to the ultimate test: is it enough to be the best? Can the best artificial intelligence overcome the friction that will be involved in using Google assistant on an iPhone? Can the best artificial intelligence actually shift human networks? Can the best artificial intelligence win the home in the face of a big head start?

> Google’s competitors, by virtue of owning the customer, need only be good enough, and they will get better. Google has a far higher bar to clear — it is asking users and in some cases their networks to not only change their behavior but willingly introduce _more_ friction into their lives — and its technology will have to be special indeed to replicate the company’s original success as a business.
