Keen observation from Matt Drance:

> The Galaxy Gear ad, and the Galaxy Gear itself, convey none of this. The ad primes us with decades of fantastic expectations — expectations which just about [any review of the product you can find](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/10/04/apple-samsung-iwatch-gear/) will tell you have not been met. It also implicitly, and very ironically, shows just how lacking in vision the product itself is.

> The iPhone ad says, “We’re starting over.” The Gear ad says, “We tried to make that exact thing you’ve seen on TV all these years.”

For comparison, here’s the first iPhone ad:

And here is the Samsung Gear ad:
