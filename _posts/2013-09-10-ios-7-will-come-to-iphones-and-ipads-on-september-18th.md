> Apple’s iOS 7 will arrive on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S on September 18th. The all-new OS will also head to the iPad mini, the third- and fourth-generation iPads, and fifth-generation iPod touch on the same day. In today’s keynote, Tim Cook boasted that the operating system will soon be “the world’s most popular operating system.” A later update will add the OS to the iPad 2 and iPhone 4.

> Announced [back in June](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4407630/apple-announces-ios-7), iOS 7 is the first major visual overhaul of the OS since its initial introduction in 2007. It features all-new icons along with redesigned core apps, a new Notification Center, webOS-inspired multitasking, and a Control Center with settings toggles, music playback, and quick shortcuts to apps. There’s also AirDrop for local file sharing over wireless, and even [Apple’s attempt at a Spotify and Rdio competitor](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715358/apple-launches-itunes-radio) in iTunes Radio.

Which means us developers should see the GM possibly later today…
