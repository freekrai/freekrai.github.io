About a 10 minute drive from my house, you run into an interesting gang of wild animals.. Peacocks!

The story behind these guys is they were once pets years ago, but now live wild throughout downtown Naramata.

They sleep in the trees, and come out during the daytime, wondering around the streets in search of food.

Recently, the local news did a [piece on it](http://www.chbcnews.ca/video/naramata+peacock+problems/video.html?v=2209800845) regarding this interesting family of birds.
