10 years ago, The CSS Zen Garden launched and brought togetherÂ tens if not hundreds of thousands of designers and developers into the modern world of CSS and semantic HTML.

I was at a talk last week at Future Insights where it was revealed that CSS Zen Garden would be getting a relaunch this week with updated HTML5 and CSS3.
