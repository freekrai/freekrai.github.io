Dan Hon:

> At the start of this year, I got diagnosed with [type 2 diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2). It’s the kind of diabetes you get if you live in the West, eat too much and don’t exercise enough. It means that I have too much glucose in my blood and my insulin isn’t able to convert enough of it into energy my cells can use. I have to admit, it wasn’t a surprise. I knew I was overweight, and had had conversations before with doctors about being pre-diabetic. This time was different. My blood sugar level wasn’t merely pre-diabetic. This time, my doctor told me in no uncertain terms that I was going to be injecting myself with insulin in the future. The Rubicon had been crossed.

Dan Hon, a writer for *Domus,* after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, turned to the Fitbit and Nike+ Fuelband to help keep fitness top-of-mind. Hon found the experiment to be largely successful, but the longer he used the devices, the more he became aware of the “Balkanisation” of his fitness data. Read more to learn about the many benefits of tracking your activity as well as the potential pitfalls of giving your fitness data over to a single source.

I’m in the same boat myself, where last January I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic and have been trying to keep it under control since. Except, I actually do have to inject myself with insulin five times a day, on top of several pills.

<div> I’ve been considering the Fitbit, Nike+ Fuelband or the Jawbone Up lately, so hearing from another diabetic who is trying out the same thing is interesting.</div>
