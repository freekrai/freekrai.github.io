MG Siegler, writing for TechCrunch:

> Well, *The Daily* failed. It wasn’t all that fun while it lasted. And it didn’t last all that long. If everyone had known that it was going to cost $25 million a year to run, it probably would have been easy to predict its eventual failure. At a high level, the reality is simple: the economics didn’t come close to working.
> 
> But because the media industry loves nothing more than talking about the media industry, today we have [dozens of stories](http://www.techmeme.com/121204/p1#a121204p1) with dozens of reasons for why *The Daily* failed. Blame News Corp. Blame Rupert Murdoch. Blame Apple. Blame Steve Jobs. Blame Eddy Cue. Blame the iPad. Blame the web. Blame native code. Blame Newsstand. Blame tablets.
> 
> As usual, when it comes to things related to Apple, John Gruber comes the closest by [keeping the explanation simple](http://daringfireball.net/2012/12/why_the_daily_failed): “don’t suck” and “start small”. If you don’t want your tablet-based publication to fail, those mantras should probably be plastered on your wall.

MG Siegler makes some great points here. It’s definitely worth a read, but  the ultimate conclusion shouldn’t come as any surprise — traditional publishers just don’t get it.
