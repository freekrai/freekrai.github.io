Jason Tucker presented an interesting presentation recently at WordCamp Phoenix 2013 that shows how meetups can stream content and make it available to everyone. Covers equipment and setup, as well as, coverage for live stream.

[He has slides for the presentation here as well](http://www.slideshare.net/jasontucker/how-to-stream-a-meetup-or-live-event)
