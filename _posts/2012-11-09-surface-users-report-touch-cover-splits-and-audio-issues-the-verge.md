Tom Warren, writing for The Verge:

> Microsoft’s Surface RT tablet has been available for just two weeks, but users are starting to notice some early issues with the device. We noted in our original Surface review that performance was a little hit or miss, but there now appear to be widespread reports related to audio problems. Several threads on Microsoft’s support forums detail issues relating to random muting and audio stuttering while the Surface is in use or on standby.
