Position a rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper and place on the prepared baking sheet. Broil, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 165 Â°F, 14 to 18 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board and slice or shred. Meanwhile, place peppers, almonds, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, paprika, cumin and crushed red pepper (if using) in a mini food processor. Puree until fairly smooth. Combine quinoa, olives, red onion and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl. To serve, divide the quinoa mixture among 4 bowls and top with equal amounts of cucumber, the chicken and the red pepper sauce. Sprinkle with feta and parsley.
Make Ahead Tip: Prepare chicken (Step 2), red pepper sauce (Step 3) and quinoa (Step 4); refrigerate in separate containers. Assemble just before serving.
