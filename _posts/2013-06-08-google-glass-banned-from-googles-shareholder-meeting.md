> 
> Google Glass is a wearable computer with a head-mounted display that’s in prototype and lets users search the web, use apps and respond to spoken instructions. However, its most controversial feature is its ability to record video, an issue that has raised privacy concerns.

> “Cameras, recording devices, and other electronic devices, such as smart phones, will not be permitted at the meeting. Photography is prohibited at the meeting,” instructions for Thursday’s 2013 annual meeting of Google shareholders in California said.
