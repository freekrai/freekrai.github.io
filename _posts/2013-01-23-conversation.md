> Shaped over centuries by countless fabled influences, the language of Newfoundland and Labrador is the province’s most charming and irresistible quality.
> 
> A fascinating mosaic of words, phrases and accents make our speech as colourful as the land where it is spoken.
> 
> There are hundreds of English dialects found here – more than anywhere else in the world, and enough to merit our very own dictionary.
> 
> While the art of conversation has long been forgotten elsewhere, it thrives right here.
> 
> The spontaneity and friendliness of our people means that a simple nod, wink or wave can turn into something truly special – and, perhaps more importantly, the beginning of a story with no end in sight.

This is an interesting video from where I’m originally from.. I grew up in Newfoundland until I was 19, then I moved to Nova Scotia for a year before moving out here to British Columbia..

But what they say about the different dialects is very true.. In Newfoundland, you can tell what town a person is from by hearing him speak.. It makes it pretty interesting
