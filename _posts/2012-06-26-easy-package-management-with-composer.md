> Let’s face it: PHP has had a rocky history with package management, and as a result, it is pretty rare to find a developer who actively uses systems like PEAR. Instead, most developers have chosen their favorite framework, which has code specifically written for it to handle various things, like DB interaction, ORM’s, OAuth, Amazon S3 integration, etc.
> 
> The downside here, though, is that switching frameworks (or returning to not using a framework at all) can be a nightmare, as it involves relearning everything to use brand new tools – and that is no easy task. Well, Composer can fix that!

Composer looks interesting, in some ways it’s similar to NPM for node.. I’ll have to play with this sometime..
