Charles Arthur takes a look at 39 shuttered Google products.

> The worry this time isn’t about privacy; it’s whether they’ll wake up in a few years’ time and read a blogpost with the doom-laden words like “sadly, it never gained the traction among users…” followed by a date when the lights will go out. And then either your data will die, or it will have to be collected and then toted around like an old sofa, which will then have to be pushed up the stairs into a new servi
