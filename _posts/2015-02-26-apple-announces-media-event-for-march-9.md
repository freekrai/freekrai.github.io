![Apple announces media event for March 9](http://rogerstringer.com/media/apple-spring-forward.jpg)

As [first reported by Jim Dalrymple at The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/02/26/apple-announces-media-event-for-march-9/), Apple will hold a special media event on March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco.

> Apple on Thursday sent out invites for a special event to be held on March 9, 2015. The event will be held in San Francisco at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, a venue that Apple has used many times before for special events.

This is widely expected to be the event where we'll see the second presentation of the Apple Watch, first unveiled alongside the iPhone 6 and Apple Pay in September 2014. Apple's CEO Tim Cook previously announced that Apple Watch will be released in April in the United States, although it's not clear when the device will be released in the rest of the world. It's possible that the event will see the company announcing official release dates for more markets this year.

Last November, Apple released WatchKit, a set of developer tools to enable app makers to develop apps for the Watch. WatchKit apps will depend on iPhone counterparts – initially, Watch apps will be included inside the same bundle of iPhone apps – and Apple will likely use the event for formal app announcements from major partners as well as independent developers on March 9.

Apple will also be streaming the [event live](http://www.apple.com/live/) as per usual.
