Sam Byford, The Verge:

> The VR system is currently codenamed Project Morpheus, and will work with PlayStation 4. While still in prototype form, Yoshida says that Morpheus is the “culmination of our work over the last three years to realize our vision of VR for games, and to push the boundaries of play.” The headset uses a 1080p LCD, offers a 90-degree field of view, and will integrate with the PlayStation Camera for tracking and PlayStation Move for motion control. It connects via HDMI and USB; while the current prototype uses a 5-meter cable, Sony would like to make it wireless. The company says the headset doesn’t put weight on your nose or cheeks, and its design allows for airflow without the lenses fogging up.

VR isn’t new, it’s been around in various stages for a few years. I’ve actually owned an older part of VR goggles for a few years that were fun to use for some gaming, but it’s making a strong comeback now, and there is a strong consensus that VR headsets are the future of gaming.
