Slack is finally pushing threaded conversations. 

> Say someone posts a message in Slack that you want to follow up on, but the deeper conversation doesnâ€™t apply to everyone. Now, you can kick off a detailed discussion on that particular topic by hovering over the message and clicking Start a thread. The right sidebar in Slack will open, and you can add your reply.

About time, as this feature was promised over a year ago.
