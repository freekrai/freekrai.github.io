> Every country has place names that make you scratch your head and say, “What were they thinking?” So I looked up what they may have been thinking when these places in Canada got their name

3 of these places are in my home province of Newfoundland, which has a wide variety of strange community names.

Names such as “Caplin Cove”, and “Come By Chance”, neither of which made the list..
