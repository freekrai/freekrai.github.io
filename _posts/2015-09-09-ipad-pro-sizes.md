I noticed something interesting with the iPad Pro, last year, Apple more or less eliminated the 32 GB models in favour of 16, 64 and 128 GB models. _Until this week, 32 GB iPads were only available with the older model iPad Air and iPad Minis._

But, this week, with the iPad Pro's launch, we're seeing the iPad Pro, which is arguably the iPad that would absolutely need space being available in 32 GB and 128 GB, with the cellular model being available only in 128 GB.

It would make sense that this move was meant to drive everyone to the higher priced 128 GB models and avoid the 32 GB model, but it's interesting to see it regardless.
