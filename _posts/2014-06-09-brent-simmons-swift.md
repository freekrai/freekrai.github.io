Brent Simmons:

> I’m lucky. [I’ve just started a Mac app](http://inessential.com/2014/05/27/vesper_2_0_with_syncing), and I plan to write it in[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).
> 
>  I’ve heard other developers say they want to wait about a year, and I totally understand that attitude. It’s reasonable to assume that Swift code written today may not compile in a few months — it’s a work in progress.
> 
>  But my thinking is this: if I start using it now, I can provide feedback, and that feedback will help shape the programming language that I’m likely to use for the rest of my career. Maybe I’ll have a ton of feedback, and maybe I’ll have none — but I’d sure hate to have missed my chance to help.
