I’ve been using status boards in some variation for years, so when Panic released the Status Board app this week for iPad. I modified my existing Google Analytics code to output a JSON string for use inside the app.

And it looks pretty good.

The biggest pain is getting your profile id, but I’ve included instructions on that in the readme, so enjoy, fork and build on this as much as you want.
