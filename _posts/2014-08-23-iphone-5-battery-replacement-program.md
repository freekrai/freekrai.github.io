Apple:

> 
>  The affected iPhone 5 devices were sold between September 2012 and January 2013 and fall within a limited serial number range.
> 
>  If your iPhone 5 is experiencing these symptoms and meets the eligibility requirements noted below, Apple will replace your iPhone 5 battery, free of charge.
