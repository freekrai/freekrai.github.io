50 Years of James Bond – The Movie:

> Approximately five minutes from each of the previous 22 James Bond films have been cut together, in order and in sequence.
> 
> This new look at the “Bond Formula” begins with the first five minutes of “Dr No”, followed by five minutes of “From Russia with Love” followed by “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball” and continues on through the remaining 18 Bond features.

This is an interesting experiment and shows how, for better or worse, each films follows the formula.
