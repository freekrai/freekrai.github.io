A new [Pebble Smartwatch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises) appeared on Kickstarter this morning, and is the fastest Kickstarter project ever to a million dollars. After less than an hour, the project had already reached $2 million.

Pebble Time ($159 on Kickstarter, $199 when it goes on sale to the general public) has a color display (but still uses e-paper, so the screen stays on and battery life is strong) and is 20% thinner than the previous Pebble.

I've owned a Pebble since last June, and wear it nearly every day. I think the Pebble Time looks fun â€”the new timeline interface is especially smart.
