> Stately is a symbol font that makes it easy to create a map of the United States using only HTML and CSS. Each state can be styled independently with CSS for making simple visualizations. And since itâ€™s a font, it scales bigger and smaller while staying sharp as a tack.

Interesting new font.. Can see a few uses for this as some clients move away from flash based maps for their websites
