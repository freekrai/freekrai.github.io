Re/code:

> Donald Trump, the billionaire and leading Republican candidate for President of the United States, says he wants Apple, the biggest technology company in the world by market valuation, to make its computers and other products in America. It made for a good sound bite, but it betrayed a deep ignorance of how the tech economy actually works and the role of American workers in it.
> 
> When it comes to understanding technology, as he has proven time and again, Trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

This guy is a complete buffoon. He’s either ignorant about the power he’d have as president or being deliberately stupid. 

Either way, he’s proving unfit for the job he wants, let alone the job he has. 

It actually makes me glad I'm not an American to worry about voting for him.
