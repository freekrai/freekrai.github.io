Ben Gilbert, writing for Engadget:

> We’re told by sources close to Samsung that a virtual reality headset is not only in the works at the company’s mobile division, but it’s set to be announced this year. The urgency is said to be a measure of beating Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Sony’s Project Morpheus to market.

About typical for Samsung, wait for someone to innovate, then copy it and rush some crap out the door to beat them to market.
