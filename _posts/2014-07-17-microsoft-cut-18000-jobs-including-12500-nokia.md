Satya Nadella, in a company-wide memo:

> Of that total, our work toward synergies and strategic alignment on Nokia Devices and Services is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs, comprising both professional and factory workers. […]
> 
>  Our workforce reductions are mainly driven by two outcomes: work simplification as well as Nokia Devices and Services integration synergies and strategic alignment. […]
> 
>  We will realize the synergies to which we committed when we announced the acquisition last September.

For perspective, Microsoft has 125,000 employees and just brought 25,000 new employees on from Nokia.

The largest layoff in Microsoft history previous to this? 5,800 people were laid off back in 2009.

This may be tough to see, but you had to know this day was coming the minute the Nokia deal was signed last year.
