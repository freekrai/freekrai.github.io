Two sentences from Rachel Andrew that explain when to reach for which layout choice:

> Flexbox is essentially for laying out items in a single dimension – in a row OR a column. Grid is for layout of items in two dimensions – rows AND columns.

Flexbox can wrap, making it sorta-kinda two dimensions, but it still flows in a single dimension.
