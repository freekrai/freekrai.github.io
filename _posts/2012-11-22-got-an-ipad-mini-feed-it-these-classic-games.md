> Earlier this month saw the launch of the iPad Mini. At the time, it wasn’t readily apparently whether the device would prove as ideal for gamers as it would be for media and web consumers. But, several weeks in, it has quickly become my go-to iOS gaming device. Why? Essentially, its weight and size make it perfect for commute gaming, whereas the standard iPad can prove too bulky for a narrow subway or airplane seat. But, because it’s considerably larger than an iPhone, there’s less of a crowded-screen-real-estate issue in games.

For those folks, as well as for folks who have a horrible memory, we thought it’d be a good idea to pick out some of our favorite iPad games so far, which should make the app-hunting process a little easier this holiday.
