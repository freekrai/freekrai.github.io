Dan Frommer:

> Apple and Amazon are both in the business of designing small computers – tablets, ereaders, phones, media players – and selling them to the public. But how they do it is the big difference. And that’s best depicted by the astonishing difference in the two companies’ profits.

Apple’s P/E: 15.86  
 Amazon’s P/E: 315.95
