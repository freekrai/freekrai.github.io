A couple weeks ago, I made the switch from Google Reader to [Fever](http://feedafever.com/). This wasn’t an easy switch as I’ve used Google Reader for years, but wanted to try something new..

So far, I’m liking it… I’ve imported my feeds from google reader and deleted the ones that were no longer useful (or hadn’t been updated in a while).

One nice thing with fever is its Hot section where it breaks down your latest articles and groups them by relevance based on topics you like.
