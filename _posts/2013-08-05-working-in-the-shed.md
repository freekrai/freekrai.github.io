Matt Gemmell:

> We live in an age of ubiquitous information and communication, so distractions have never been more pervasive. We have too many choices of what to look at or focus attention on. The internet is a glittering carnival of diversions, and that’s wonderful – until you need to get some work done.

> The enemy here isn’t the net, of course; it’s you. You’re the one being distracted.
