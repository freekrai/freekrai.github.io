> Blizzard Entertainment’s big game reveal at PAX East is Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, a free-to-play collectible card game that’s coming to PC, Mac, and eventually iPad.

You’ll also be able to earn or buy additional packs of cards. They’re showing off a playable build of the game at PAX East, which kicks off in Boston, MA today, and Blizzard expects to release the game this year. Mac and PC version first, iPad to follow.

This is the first game Blizzard will make for any iOS device.
