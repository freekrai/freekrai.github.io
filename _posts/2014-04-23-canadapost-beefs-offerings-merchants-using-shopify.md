> 
> The crown corporation <span style="color: #323232;">is teaming up with e-commerce platform providers like [Shopify](http://www.shopify.ca/) to make it easier for small businesses to go online and grow their business. The new program will be offered by e-commerce software solution providers to their users, with incentives on shipping services by Canada Post, the largest delivery network in the country.</span>
> 
> <span style="color: #323232;">The e-commerce platforms already offer Canada Post shipping services, including shipping labels, rating, and tracking capabilities. By integrating their Canada Post customer account into e-commerce platforms, merchants will have access to streamlined built-in services such as creating and printing shipping labels, incorporating tracking directly into their online stores as well as accessing the most convenient return process in the country. In addition, they will qualify for an exclusive incentive offer through their software provider.</span>
> 
> <span style="color: #323232;">To benefit from the incentive offer, merchants must connect their new or existing online store with their Canada Post account for the first time through an approved participating solution provider such as Magento, Shopify, 3dcart, WooCommerce, Shopsite, Ordercup and ShipStation.
