> Maps are a highly competitive corner of the mobile device landscape. Today, Google added features that make it easier for users to add new places, suggest edits to locations, and verify other usersâ€™ submissions.
> 
> [Google announced on the Google Maps blog](https://maps.googleblog.com/2016/07/more-ways-to-share-your-street-smarts.html) that adding and editing locations has been expanded worldwide in Google Maps and Google Search. In my limited tests, I only saw links to edit locations in Google Maps, but it may be that the feature is still being rolled out to Search.
