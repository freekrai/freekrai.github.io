> About a year ago, we released a little app for the iPhone and iPad called Dark Sky, attempting to do something new and interesting for weather forecasting, a field we think had become pretty stagnant. Approaching 100k sales, it’s been fairly successful; however, we’ve been continually asked for more: international support, longer-term forecasting, an Android app, and so on.
> 
> Rather than cram these things into Dark Sky, we decided to do something grander: create our own full-featured weather service from scratch, complete with 7-day forecasts that cover the whole world, beautiful weather visualizations, and a time machine for exploring the weather in the past and far future.

The guys at Dark Sky just released this [Brand new](http://blog.forecast.io/post/46290267206/announcing-forecast) weather Web app, and it is very nice.

There’s a whole lot of weather forecast information here and it’s extremely well laid out and presented.

The mobile version on the iPhone is equally impressive.
