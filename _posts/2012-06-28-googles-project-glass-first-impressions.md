Joshua Topolsky for The Verge:

> I just had a bizarre and fairly interesting experience here at Google I/O 2012. After a small, closed press session on Google’s Project Glass, company co-founder Sergey Brin decided to let the press here try on the devices for themselves. Including his personal pair.

Joshua gave us his opinion of Project Glass, and it seems right now, while interesting, there are some drawbacks such as resolution.

I’m interested to see how this turns out, I’ve always been a fan of wearable computers, and even own a set of VR goggles that I bought 5 years ago that I still use sometimes for gaming when I’m bored.
