Harrison Weber at TNW:

> Adobe has shared with us that Creative Suite 6 will still be available for purchase, but it will not be updated beyond addressing bugs and OS compatibility. There will be no Creative Suite 7.
> 
> Instead, Adobe is pointing all of its energy towards Creative Cloud, eliminating the familiar retail box in the process. â€¦
> 
> According to our sources, the company had long searched for ways to stabilize its revenue. Previously, it would receive bursts of income every two years with the latest Creative Suite release. Convincing users to upgrade was a daunting task that left an impact on product decisions.
