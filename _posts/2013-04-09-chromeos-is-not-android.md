The title of this post may sound strange but its true..

Now that chromebooks are in Canada, there is a noticeable problem with people who think that ChromeOS is just a desktop version of Android..

This was one comment I heard today:

> The only problem with the chromebook is I canâ€™t install APPS like Skype and FLV Players which are available on the Google Play Store and can be installed on my phone and tablet.

First of all.. Admittedly.. Being able to install the google play app on a chromebook is a good cause for confusion, but Google really needs to work on its image and education.

I love chromebooks, they have their purpose and the apps that are available work well, but there is way too much confusion going around..
