> So the question is not whether Twitter’s going to cut Flipboard off, it’s simply when: Will it wait until the new rules kick into place in six months? Or will it go after Flipboard sooner, with the ensuing election news extravaganza coming up?

I think Flipboard is next, twitter has already cut off LinkedIn, Instagram and now Tumblr…
