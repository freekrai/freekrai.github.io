Marco Arment:

> I originally designed the Apple Watch app for my podcast player, [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), with a scaled-down version of the iPhone app’s structure.
>
> This seemed like a sensible adaptation of my iOS app to the Apple Watch. In practice, **it sucked.**

I use Overcast as my main podcast app, but I decided to stay with my Pebble instead of getting an Apple Watch so I make use of the built-in audio remote on the Pebble. The app is basic; essentially consisting of *play / pause*, *rewind*, and *skip* but it works fine.
