> “There’s nothing that would keep Apple out of the Android market as a secondary phone market,” said Wozniak – who, it should be noted, is no longer involved in the day-to-day workings of the company. “We could compete very well. People like the precious looks of stylings and manufacturing that we do in our product compared to the other Android offerings. We could play in two arenas at the same time.”

When it comes to Woz… I’m afraid to ask if he’s joking or actually serious… His use of Android phones along with iPhones is well known… But I don’t see Apple ever making an Android phone…
