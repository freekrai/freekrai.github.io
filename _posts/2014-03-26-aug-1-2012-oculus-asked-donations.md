> What did you get in return for an investment? Everybody who funded the company with $10 was promised “a sincere thank you from the Oculus team” and regular updates on the project. When the funding period closed at the beginning of September, 1,009 people had kicked in ten bucks each. A $25 investment got you a T-Shirt as well as a thank you.
> 
> The real action was the $300 investment: for that, you we promised an early “developer kit” including a prototype headset and access to the software development tools needed to built games for the headset. 5,642 people signed up for that. In total, the campaign raised [$2.4 million from 9,500 contributor](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game)s
