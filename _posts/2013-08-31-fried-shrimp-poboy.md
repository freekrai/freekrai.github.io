I love Po’boys, and you can use just about any type of meat for them, but this recipe uses the classic fried shrimp, and it as favorite..

### **What You Need**

- Vegetable oil, for frying
- 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons creole seasoning, recipe follows
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 3/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal
- 2 small French bread loaves, each about 10-inches long
- 4 tablespoons melted butter
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste
- Red pepper sauce
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 1 large ripe beefsteak tomato, thinly sliced
- Sliced dill pickles, optional
- Hot sauce, for serving, optional
- Potato chips, for serving, optional (recommended: Zapp’s)
- **Creole Seasoning**- 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- *Combine all ingredients thoroughly.*

### **How To Make It:**

1. Heat the oil in a large sauce pan or preheat a deep fryer to 360 degrees F.
2. Season the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of the creole seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne.
3. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour and cornmeal and season with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the creole seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne.
4. Dredge the shrimp in the seasoned flour mixture, coating the shrimp completely.
5. Fry the shrimp in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes.
6. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with salt and hot sauce.
7. Split the French bread loaves in half and brush both cut sides of the bread with some of the melted butter.
8. Using a spatula, spread the mayonnaise on both sides of the bread, then sprinkle with hot sauce.
9. Divide the shrimp evenly between the 2 sandwiches and garnish with the lettuce, tomato slices, sliced pickles and hot sauce, if desired.
10. Serve with potato chips.
