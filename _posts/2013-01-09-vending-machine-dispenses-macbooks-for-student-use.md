> Providing a solution to students who donâ€™t want to carry a laptop while walking late at night from their dorm or off-campus housing to the library, Drexel introduced a 24-hour, self-service kiosk located in its Hagerty Library that will dispense MacBooks to students, faculty and staff. Drexel is the third university on the East Coast to introduce the vending machine, which holds up to 12 MacBooks that could be checked out free by anyone with a Drexel ID for five hours of use.
> 
> Drexel will evaluate the use of the kiosk and results will determine if additional vending machines can be added in the libraries or around campus. Ipads are also being considered for future kiosks. This is the latest in a series of innovative initiatives by Drexel Libraries.

Interesting idea..
