> Thanks to the growing acceptance of WOFF and services such as Typekit, Fontdeck, Font Squirrel, and Fontspring, web fonts are everywhere. Now that web designers have access to more type choices, they want the same level of control over fonts that print designers have.
> 
> While much can be achieved with web-safe fonts and core CSS properties such as font-weight or letter-spacing, many CSS3 properties can now be used to provide even greater control. WebKit browsers have a little-known but fantastic property that can be applied to text called mask-image.
> 
> Mask-image can be used to knock out small textural pieces of headline text. Using this technique with paragraph text would hurt readability, but when applied to a large-format display font, it can create a subtle point of interest.
> 
> Though itâ€™s currently only a WebKit safe (Safari and Chrome) property, it degrades gracefully by just showing no texture to non-supporting browsers.
