> My Twitter feed just exploded with the news that numerous long-time Macworld editors, including Dan Frakes, Roman Loyola, Philip Michaels, Dan Miller, and Dan Moren have been laid off. (There is no truth the rumor that Macworld parent IDG just had too many editors named “Dan” on the books.) In addition, [Jason Snell has quit](http://snellworld.com/); he was a senior vice president and editorial director for IDG Consumer.
