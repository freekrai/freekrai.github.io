[MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/linked/status-board-links/) has shared a list of Status Board Links that have been posted online to make Panic’s Status Board app even more useful.

I’ve already spent a few hours getting my own stats incorporated into the app and it’s pretty nice so far.

I’m currently displaying email, twitter info, calendar, stats from Mint on The Interviewr, Stats on number of interviews vs signups, a list of tasks exported from Basecamp and a table of overall user signups and interviews.

This app is handy, and the community is rapidly growing with new links to make things nice.
