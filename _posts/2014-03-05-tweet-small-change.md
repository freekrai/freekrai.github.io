Interesting and clever new project from Patrick Rhone and Bethany Gladhill:

> Tweet Small Change is $140.00 micro-grants given to compelling arts projects that are pitched via tweets.

Tweet Small Change just launched today, and they are accepting submissions. You submit your grant request [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/achangetweet). You can read more about it [on Patrick’s site](http://patrickrhone.com/2014/03/04/announcing-tweet-small-change/).
