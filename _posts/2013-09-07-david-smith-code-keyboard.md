David Smith:

> Last week when Jeff Atwood announced that he had designed and developed a keyboard I immediately took notice. His CODE Keyboard seemed to have been very thoughtfully designed and had me intrigued. It is hard to argue with the pedigree of something I’d use everyday designed by someone who does what I do everyday. I ordered one and yesterday it arrived.
> 
> It probably makes sense to give a bit of context for my keyboard history. Since 2005, when it was first introduced, I’ve almost exclusively been using the Microsoft® Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 v1.0. While, thankfully, I’ve never had serious issues with RSI I never wanted to get anywhere close to it. Back then I found that after long sessions of intense work I’d start to get a slight ache in my wrists with a traditional keyboard. So I proactively sought out something to avoid even the hint of danger.

> After using it for around 4 hours I started feeling the tell-tale ache in my wrists. I’m not sure if this would ever turn into something serious but I can’t take that risk.

> The keyboard itself, however, was excellent. It is well built. The sound and action are very satisfying. The backlight is surprisingly useful. I really wish I could use it long term but it just doesn’t fit my physical needs.
