Esteban Israel, reporting for Reuters:

> But soccer world governing body FIFA’s licensing agreement with rival electronics maker Sony Corp means players have to take them off when they are in World Cup stadiums for official matches and media events.
> 
>  Marketing experts say that probably only amplifies their appeal.
> 
>  “When fans see World Cup athletes wearing Beats in their downtime, by choice, it has as much impact as seeing them lace their Adidas (boots) or sip a sponsored beverage,” said strategist Ellen Petry Leanse, a former Apple and Google executive.
> 
>  “Maybe more, actually — Beats isn’t a sponsor, so the message is more authentic and credible.”
