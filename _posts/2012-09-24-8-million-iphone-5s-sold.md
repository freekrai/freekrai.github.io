John Paczkowski, All Things D:

> “We have counted iPhone launch day lines at every launch since the iPhone 3G in 2008,” Munster said in a note to clients. “We believe that based on our count of 775 customers in line for the iPhone 5 at the flagship 5th Avenue store, demand for the iPhone 5 is higher than any previous launch. We believe the line for the iPhone 5 was 70 percent greater than the line for the iPhone 4S despite Apple taking 2x as many online preorders… Given the strength of the line for the iPhone 5, we are incrementally more confident in Apple?s ability to sell 8 million phones in the launch weekend.”“
