Those who know me, know I like all sorts of music. Rock, metal, country, folk, blues, jazz, some rap. I don’t really care what type it is, I like how it sounds.

And the canadian band, Walk Off The Earth, is one such band who’s music I really like. It’s catchy, it’s sometimes goofy, and they’re the only band I know of where a bearded guy can rock a xylophone..

This video is for Red Hands, a song on their recent R.E.V.O CD.

R.E.V.O is short for the band’s motto: “Realize Every Victory Outright”, which is a good motto to have, and one the band follows, and one everyone should follow.
