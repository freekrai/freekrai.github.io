Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 2nd, runs through June 6th, at its usual spot in Moscone West in San Francisco.

> Developers can apply for tickets via the WWDC website ([developer.apple.com/wwdc](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc)) now through Monday, April 7 at 10:00 a.m. PDT, and tickets will be issued to attendees through random selection. Developers will know their status by Monday, April 7 at 5:00 p.m. PDT. There will also be 200 Student Scholarships available, giving students around the world the chance to earn a free ticket ([developer.apple.com/wwdc/students](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/students)). This year the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) and its alliance partners will help promote scholarships to female engineers and coders.

The WWDC lotto is an interesting solution to the usual selling out of tickets in minutes….
