Guy English:

> Steve Ballmer announced today that he will be stepping down as CEO of Microsoft within the next twelve months. This comes a little over a month since Microsoft announced a massive reorganization which was aimed at breaking down old fiefdoms and setting a new course.
> 
> To quote the [Microsoft press release](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/aug13/08-23AnnouncementPR.aspx):
> 
> Microsoft Corp. today announced that Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has decided to retire as CEO within the next 12 months, upon the completion of a process to choose his successor.
> 
> No successor has been chosen yet. At least not one they’re willing to announce yet.
> 
> Regardless of how you feel about Ballmer’s ability to lead Microsoft, his ability to have his company adapt to the quickly shifting fulcrum from desktop to mobile, or his ability to address his customers and developers in a respectful manner; this is terrible timing.
> 
> Ballmer writes in his [farewell memo](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/enterprise/383797/ballmers-farewell-memo-to-microsoft-employees#ixzz2cpFjAOrA):
> 
> There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time.
> 
> No. It’s not.

Ballmer is leaving behind a huge mess…
