> Apple today introduced an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, featuring the worldâ€™s most advanced display with ProMotion technology and incredible performance with the new A10X Fusion chip. 
> 
> The new 10.5-inch model reduces the borders by nearly 40 percent to fit into an incredibly compact package that still weighs just one pound. Combined with powerful new iPad features in iOS 11 coming this fall, like the all-new Files app, customizable Dock, improved multitasking and deeper integration of Apple Pencil, iPad Pro gives users the ability to be even more productive and creative.

I still like the 9.7-inch iPad size, but I also enjoy using my iPad Pro for the bigger screen.

The 10.5 should be an interesting combination of both sizes.
