Tim Cook:

> Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and services that we can’t wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans.

In other words, no new iPhone or iPads until the fall.

Apple doesn’t usually come right out and say something like this so straight forwardly, so that was a bit unusual for them to announce..

Most likely, they’re trying to wait for WWDC in June so they can announce new things then..

> We will continue to focus on the long term, and we remain very optimistic about our future. We’re participating in large and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long-term prospects of the smartphone and tablet markets, the strength of our incredible ecosystem which we plan to continue to augment with services, our plans for expanded distribution, and the potential of exciting new product categories.

Apple considers Tablets, phones and computers as product categories. So this is obviously talking about an entirely new product category.. Maybe the rumoured iWatch? or maybe an iGlass?
