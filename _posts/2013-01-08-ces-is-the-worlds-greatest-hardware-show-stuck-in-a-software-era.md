Mat Honan on why CES matters so little around:

> We live in a software-driven world. Hardware is merely the foundation that it is built upon.
> 
> This is a problem for CES, which has never really been a show about software. As software matters more and more, CES matters less and less.

For me, why CES means so little is that most of the really cool hardware that gets demoed at trade shows suc as CES, never makes it into an actual shipped product.
