The Verge:

> Broadcasters argued that unlike Cablevision, Aereo lacked the proper license to operate — but the court ruled that the license doesn’t matter since Aereo customers are streaming their own unique copies to themselves. The remarkably tech-savvy decision for Aereo today clears major legal difficulties for the web-television broadcaster, and will force TV networks to win an appeal either in front of the full Second Circuit or Supreme Court if they want to shut the streaming service down. “The Second Circuit stomped the broadcasters pretty hard,” said The Verge’s Nilay Patel.

Similar to how slingbox works.. Great loophole to get around licensing..
