*The White Shadow* (1924) is Alfred Hitchcock’s earliest known surviving film, with 2 caveats: only 3 reels of the total 6 have been discovered & Hitchcock wrote the script and edited the film but did not direct it.

[The White Shadow is available to stream on the National Film Preservation Foundation website through January 15th, 2013.](http://www.filmpreservation.org/preserved-films/screening-room/the-white-shadow-1924)
