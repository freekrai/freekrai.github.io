> Microsoft has proven it can build a nice-looking tablet [with the Surface RT](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review).

The Surface Pro was for months just a mythical device, Microsoft’s unreleased attempt to blend both beauty and power into the perfect Windows 8 machine.
