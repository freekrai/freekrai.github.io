Ray Bradbury passed away today at age 91. His writing has been there for many people over the past decades, and inspired much more great writing from other authors who followed in his footsteps..

One of my favorite Bradbury quotes:

> You must write every single day of your life… You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads… may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days. And out of that love, remake a world.
