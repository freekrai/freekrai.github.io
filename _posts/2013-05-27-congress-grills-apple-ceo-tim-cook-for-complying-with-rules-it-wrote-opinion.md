John E Sununu, former Republican senator from NH, for the Boston Globe:

> Senator Levin and his staff believe that it is wrong for companies and individuals to engage in behavior that avoids taxes. They hoped that calling out Cook might generate support for legislation that targets companies like Apple. Instead, they mostly provided a lesson in the complex, convoluted, and often uncompetitive nature of Americaâ€™s corporate tax code. They also provided a reminder that those responsible for the mess were asking the questions, not sitting at the witness table.
