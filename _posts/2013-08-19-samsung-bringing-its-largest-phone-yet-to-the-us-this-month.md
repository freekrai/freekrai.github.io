> Samsung announced today that the [Galaxy Mega 6.3](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4212122/samsung-galaxy-mega-58-63-pictures-specs-release-date), the company’s biggest “phone” device to date, will be available in the US this month. The Mega 6.3 has a 6.3-inch, 720p display; 1.7GHz dual-core processor; 8-megapixel camera; and Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with Samsung’s user interface. Fueling that enormous display is a 3,200mAh battery, and the Mega will run on LTE networks here in the US. AT&T, Sprint, and US Cellular will carry the Mega 6.3, which will come in black or white color options, though pricing and an exact release date have yet to be announced.

Seriously Samsung? Seriously? We really need a 6.3 inch phone?

Why don’t you just make the Galaxy Note 8.0 into a phone?
