Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher:

> So, as a memorial to a great man and in the spirit of sharing a priceless piece of history, we are making all six of these appearances available on iTunes for free, in high-quality video. We thank Apple for its cooperation in making these videos available for all.

This is the first D Conference since Steve Jobs passed away last October. This was the only non-apple event he attended and he went to 6 of the previous 9, including attending with Bill Gates with 2007. So it’s interesting watching these videos now, when D10 is going on without him.
