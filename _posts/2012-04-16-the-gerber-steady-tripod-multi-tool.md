I picked up the [Gerber Steady Tripod Multi-Tool](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006M9NK14/phpprof-20) last week since it looked interesting.

> This multi-tool for the digitally-connected nature lover features 12 components, including both a fine and a serrated blade, bottle opener, pliers and wire cutters, screwdrivers.
> 
> But it also serves as a tripod for your camera and/or iPhone thanks to its screw-on attachment joint for your camera or a suction cup to mount your iPhone with.
> 
> Now you can use one tool to protect yourself from a wild boar, film a quick YouTube video after your hunting expedition, and then snuggle up to a nice Netflix video by the campfire.

### So how have I found it after a couple days?

Well, the tripod functionality is nice, really nice, and very handy.

I’ve found the suction cup works best when you use your phone either not in a case, or in a non-rubberized case, such as the Case-mate barely there case. Where the tripod really shines though is  
 when you use it with a [Glif+ from studio neat](/2012/03/29/glifplus).

Replace the suction cup attachment with a glif, and you can then set your up phone nicely. Even better, add an [Ōlloclip](/2012/04/05/olloclip-3-in-1-iphone-lens) to the mix, and you have a nice portable iPhone setup.

### Any cons?

Mostly, my biggest con has been that the handle is plastic, and some of the tools are a little hard to get out with your fingers. But I’ve found the tools are easier after a little working, so not a big con.

### Recommend to others?

Absolutely, I highly recommend this to anyone who is an avid iPhone photo nerd who wants a nice portable toolkit to carry around including a handy tripod.
