There are many different tools, and templates for prototyping apps, but today I came across a framework different that should appeal to any designer who would prefer to prototype their apps using standard web languages.

The framework is Ratchet an MIT licensed solution for prototyping iOS apps.

With Ratchet you prototype your apps using a HTML/CSS syntax, and the Javascript framework provides many different iOS style components, and makes your prototypes interactive. While the project is new there are already many standard components available.

You can download Ratchet through the [home page here.](http://maker.github.com/ratchet/)

If you clone the Github repository with:


    git clone https://github.com/maker/ratchet.git
    


Youâ€™ll find an example in the test/app directory.

A very professional looking solution for prototyping apps.
