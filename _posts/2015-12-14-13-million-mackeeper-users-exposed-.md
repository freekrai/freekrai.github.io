> The makers of MacKeeper — a [much-maligned](http://www.macworld.com/article/2861435/software-utilities/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html) software utility many consider to be little more than [scareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKeeper) that targets Mac users — have acknowledged a breach that exposed the usernames, passwords and other information on more than 13 million customers and, er … users.

That there are 13 million Mac users who’ve fallen for the MacKeeper scam is just heartbreaking. It’s bad enough they were ripping people off in the first place — now they’ve exposed their passwords.
