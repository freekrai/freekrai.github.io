> The makers of MacKeeper — a [much-maligned](http://www.macworld.com/article/2861435/software-utilities/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html) software utility many consider to be little more than [scareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKeeper) that targets Mac users — have acknowledged a breach that exposed the usernames, passwords and other information on more than 13 million customers and, er … users.

The fact that there are actuall 13 million Mac users who’ve fallen for the MacKeeper scam is just heartbreaking. 

And it was bad enough that they were ripping people off in the first place — now they’ve exposed their passwords.

Maybe this will be a lesson to MacKeeper to finally disapear?
