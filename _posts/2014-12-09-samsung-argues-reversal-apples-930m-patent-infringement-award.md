> During an appearance before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday, lawyers for Samsung sought to have vacated the $930 million judgement awarded to Apple earlier this year in a landmark patent infringement lawsuit, saying the sum was “absurd.”

What is absurd is that Samsung made so much money from copying Apple’s design. The judgement against Samsung should have been much more.
