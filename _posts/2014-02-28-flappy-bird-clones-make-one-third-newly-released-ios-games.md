Juli Clover at MacRumors:

> Over a 24-hour period beginning yesterday, approximately 293 new iOS games have been released into the App Store. 95 of those games are either Flappy Bird clones or heavily inspired by the original Flappy Bird title, according to data gathered byÂ [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/27/flappy-bird-clones-iphone-ipad).

Between this and the various iOS devices being sold at high prices simply because it has Flappy bird installed on it..
