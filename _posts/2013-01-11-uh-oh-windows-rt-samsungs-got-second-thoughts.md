> Mike Abary, the head of Samsung’s PC and tablet business in the U.S., tells CNET that the company will not be releasing its Windows RT device in the U.S. because retail partners don’t see strong demand and because the value proposition for Windows RT isn’t clear to consumers.

Actually, that’s no surprise.. There’s more to do on a Windows 8 device than a Windows RT device currently, so more people are going to be interested in the non-RT tablets
