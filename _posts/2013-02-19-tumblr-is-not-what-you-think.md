Adam Rifkin:

> Tumblr provides its users with the oldest privacy-control strategy on the Internet: security through obscurity and multiple pseudonymity. Its users prefer a coarse-grained scheme they can easily understand over a sophisticated fine-grained privacy control — such as Facebook provides — that requires a lot of time and patience. To quote Sweet Brown, [Ain’t nobody got time for that](http://pandawhale.com/post/6769/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that-meme-gif).
> 
> Tumblr proves that the issue is less about public vs. private and more about whether you are findable and identifiable by people who actually know you in real life.
