Don Melton, recently retired, and now writing for his new website:

> Ten years ago this month, my secret Web browser team at Apple became the “Safari” team — less than 30 days before we debuted the product on January 7, 2003.
> 
> To this day, I don’t know who suggested the name “Safari.” I wasn’t in the room when the heavens split asunder and angels sounded forth as a choir singing that three-syllable benediction. But I had been part of the naming discussion before. Several times.

Interesting reading from one of the original Safari developers.
