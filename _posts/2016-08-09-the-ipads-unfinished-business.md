[Jean-Louis Gassée](https://mondaynote.com/ipad-unfinished-business-7c878a9e5122#.qak8oj3o9): 

> The iPad Pro undoubtedly appeals to a more demanding base of users than the smaller iPads. iOS is “growing windows”, a more visible file system and, in a soon to be available version, will provide easier access to documents on a Mac Desktop or Documents folder. We’ve yet to see if these improvements help Mac users actually create more on their iPads, or if they merely make life more pleasant for those fortunate enough to commute between the two devices. In the longer run, progressively beefing up the simpler/cleaner iOS is a better bet than adding more layers of bug fixes and features on top of the noble and worthy OS X, now macOS.

> The original iPad and iPad Mini, on the other hand, pretty much fully satisfy the “non-pro” users who don’t need to do much more than message family and friends, navigate social websites, share pictures, watch videos, and so on.

And [Dave Marks](http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/08/09/the-ipads-unfinished-business/) as part of his reply:

> Will the next generation of iPads cross the chasm and offer the interface power and usability of the Mac? Will the next generation of MacBook Pros grow closer to the iPad? What if the iPad added a keyboard case with the ability to attach a trackpad and mouse? What if the next MacBook Pro had a touchscreen and could split like the Surface? Will the Mac ever run iOS apps? Or, perhaps, iOS itself?

Jean-Louis and Dave both have a few good points here. I actually find myself wishing the smart keyboard had a trackpad several times, or sometimes an `esc` key (_and yes, I know there is a virtual `esc` key, but it's not always available on some apps so it's annoying_), but it's workable and lets me do my work without any problem.

Dave's final question is also good, and has been asked before... Will the iPad become more like the Mac? or will the Mac become more like the Ipad
