Paul Graham:

> You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. 
> 
> They use different words, certainly. But even those they use no more than necessary. And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove, and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the less you can afford to let language get in the way.

I try to keep my writing from being too technical and complex, sometimes it may be necessary to get a little complex in a tutorial, but keeping the actual wording as normal as you can.
