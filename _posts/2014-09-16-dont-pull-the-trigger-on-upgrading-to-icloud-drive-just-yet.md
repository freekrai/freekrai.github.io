![Don’t pull the trigger on upgrading to iCloud Drive just yet](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0008.png "Don’t pull the trigger on upgrading to iCloud Drive just yet")

> If you’re upgrading to iOS 8 on Wednesday, you must resist the urge to upgrade to iCloud Drive if you want to continue to sync your phone to your Mac. Why? Well, iCloud Drive only works with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. And you all know which OS we’re still waiting on.

I honestly hadn’t even thought about this, but it’s a valid point.

iCloud Drive depends to Yosemite and until Yosemite drops, you could get yourself in a world of hurt.
