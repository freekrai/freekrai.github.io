Interesting take on the problem of responsive tables…

> We looked at the current state of responsive tables, and we weren’t happy. Today we’ve released a new playground piece, with a new, awesome take on responsive tables.
> 
> If you’ve ever tried to make large data tables work in a responsive design, you know what a pain they can be. Tables have a magical property that says they can never be so small that parts of a word have to be cut off — they can’t overflow. That means that, when your design shrinks down for the width of, say a smartphone, large data tables will ensure your design doesn’t actually shrink all the way down. It sucks.
> 
> We wanted to try and do better, so we got to work on a responsive table implementation that would meet three criteria:
> 
> - Doesn’t break responsive layouts
> - Doesn’t unnecessarily hide table data
> - Still allows you to compare rows with a key column
