Mike Isaac writing for AllThingsD:

> On June 29, Twitter VP of Product Michael Sippey posted a foreboding 439-word letter to the company blog, broadly sketching the direction Twitter’s platform is headed.
> 
> Upon its reception, most of the public attention focused on a single passage, which stated that Twitter will soon introduce stricter guidelines to its developer partners in the coming weeks, limiting the ways in which outsiders will be able to use Twitter’s rich, ceaseless stream of data.

What’s happening with Twitter’s Platform is interesting and has an affect on developers who use their API so it’s worth watching.
