Furby, the most annoying toy ever in any decade, has returned for a second re-release..

Originally out in the 90s, this talking toy drove many parents and pets crazy with its random talking, and it’s now come back again..

And this time, it has an iOS and Android app that you can use to feed it..

My daughter actually loves Furby, and wanted one as soon as she heard they were coming back, but my wife is doing her best to try to talk her out of it, but I have my doubts that she will.
