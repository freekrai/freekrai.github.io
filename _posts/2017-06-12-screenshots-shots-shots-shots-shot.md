Up until now, the screenshot has almost been a hidden functionality. Yes, anyone can do it, but it’s not exactly like Apple gives you a tutorial when you first get an iPhone. And it’s not exactly like the power-plus-home button combo is natural. But because this has been the standard with the iPhone from the beginning (even with the move of the power button to the side from the top), the knowledge has seemingly been passed down like an ancient ritual amongst a tribe. And now we see a lot of people taking screenshots of things within iOS and sharing them throughout the web.

While such functionality was highlighted during the WWDC keynote for the iPad Pro, it works with an iPhone with iOS 11 too. And it looks perfect.

> I don’t know about you, but I take screenshots left-and-right. And I do this both for archival purposes, but also to be able to share something quickly. The problem is that right now, “quickly” means taking the shot, quitting whatever you’re doing, opening the Photos app, opening the screenshot, editing it, and then finally sharing it. In bulk, over time, this is tedious. The new workflow is so much better.

> Not only can you open the screenshot immediately now, but again, you can edit it right away. And not only can you do something like crop it, you can actually mark it up in a very simple way. This is not that easy to do right now, and requires several taps. And it’s far beyond what an average iPhone user would ever do.

I take a lot of screenshots so this can be a handy feature to have.
