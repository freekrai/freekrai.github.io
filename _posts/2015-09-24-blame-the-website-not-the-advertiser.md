With all the news about ad blockers, and the evils of ads, it's refreshing to see someone reminding people that the ads aren't the problem, as much as people who abuse the ad services on their sites.

I like to keep ads to a minimal on this site, I display a carbonads ad on the top of the site and that's it.
