> If you like to keep organized, then you want a todo app. In this tutorial, we’re going to build a simple real-time todo app.
> 
>  This app will consist of four functions:
> 
> 1. Add new items to do
> 2. Mark items as done
> 3. Mark items as not done (undo)
> 4. Delete items
> 
>  This is simple functionality, but it is exactly what a todo app is all about, and can run anywhere as this will consist of an html file, a javascript file and some very basic css.
> 
>  All you need to build your todo app is a free [Data McFly](http://datamcfly.com) account. There’s no server-side programming needed for this app.

This was a quick, fun tutorial to write. Showing how to build a simple todo list app using Data McFly.
