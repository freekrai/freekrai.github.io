Kara Swisher:

> As part of the deal, Tumblr CEO David Karp — who got a windfall of cash from the deal — will stay at Yahoo for four years at least and retain much control over the service, much in the same way Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom does at Facebook. But, as there, Yahoo will undergird Tumblr’s nascent advertising business with its large and established infrastructure.

This could go either way.. If they treat Timblr the way Twitter treated Posterous.. Then that’s bad.. But if they treat Tumblr the way Facebook has treated Instagram, then this could work out well for everyone..
