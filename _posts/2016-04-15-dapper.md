I grew up in Newfoundland, some of my earliest memories involve going fishing for your dinner. So when I saw these dapper vigilante rope bracelets, I ordered one immediately, the fine folks at Dapper Vigilante actually threw in the fish hook bracelet as a gift, which was a nice thing to do as I was planning on ordering that one next.

These bracelets are a nice conversation piece, people ask all the time where I got them. For me, it's the simplicity of them, they are essentially a piece of rope with an anchor or a fish hook attached to it, but I like it.
