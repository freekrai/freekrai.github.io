> f you are going to create an attack ad, it better be either irrefutably in-the-right or incredibly clever. This ad makes the case that the Chromebook is not a real laptop, that when it is not connected to the internet, it is “pretty much a brick.” I don’t own a Chromebook, and I’m not necessarily a Chromebook fan, but fair is fair. A “brick”? It took me all of 2 minutes reading reviews to dispel this myth.

Chromebooks have more use than what Microsoft seems to think.. And they’re not “online only” as implied here either..

I think they just got tired of going after the iPad with their Surface ads and had to look for another target.
