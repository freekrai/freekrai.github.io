John Moltz:

> Mary Jo Foley:
> 
> > Windows “Threshold,” the next major version of Microsoft’s Windows operating system due to hit around the spring of 2015, is coming into focus.
> > 
> > And not too surprisingly, one of the Microsoft Operating Systems Group’s main goals in designing and developing the coming operating system (OS) release — which may or may not ultimately be branded as “Windows 9″ — is to try to make it more palatable to hold-out Windows 7 users.
> 
> I know we’ve been over this again and again, but in addition to the conceptual flaw of trying to make one operating system for desktop and mobile, there’s a marketing problem as well. Apple was able to make iOS palatable to its existing customers (as well as others) by detaching it from OS X. If Apple had also forced its desktop operating system clients to a Springboard UI, everyone would still be on Tiger.
> 
> You can certainly give Microsoft credit for trying something new, but it didn’t work. And they’re still trying to unravel it.

John is right on the money here, Microsoft is moving into bad territory with Threshold, but on the bright side, if nothing else, it will drive more PC users to buy a Mac…
