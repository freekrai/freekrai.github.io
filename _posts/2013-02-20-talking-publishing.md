Great conversation between Ben Brooks and Marco Arment:

> BB: To your point about a fresh take always having a shot, how do you plan on keeping The Magazine fresh — is that solely done through the content, or through exploring more publishing styles and avenues?
> 
> MA: I think it’ll be done primarily through content. Content is enough if it’s good.
