> In this article we are going to compare three popular MV* frameworks for the web: AngularJS vs. Backbone vs. Ember. Choosing the right framework for your project can have a huge impact on your ability to deliver on time, and your ability to maintain your code in the future. You probably want a solid, stable and proven framework to build upon, but don’t want to be limited by your choice. The web in evolving fast — new technologies arise, and old methodologies quickly become irrelevant. Under this light, we are going to go through an in-depth comparison of the three frameworks.

A nice side by side comparison of AngularJS, Backbone and Ember.

I actually prefer AngularJS myself these days.
