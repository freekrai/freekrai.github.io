[Twelve South](http://twelvesouth.com/), makers of excellent Mac and iOS device accessories, have announced today the latest product in their family of accessories for the iPhone: the [SurfacePad](http://twelvesouth.com/products/surfacepad_iphone/). Made of Napa leather and weighing less than an ounce, the SurfacePad is a modern, minimal design that beautifully complements the stylish design of iPhone.

> What makes SurfacePad special is what it’s not: a military-style rubber grenade for your iPhone. SurfacePad is an ultra-thin, luxury leather cover that shields iPhone 5 or 4/4S from the more typical hazards of life, like the change in your pocket, jump drive in your backpack or the nail file in your purse. It allows you to set your iPhone down on rough spots like a concrete bench or stone tabletop without worrying about scratching the sleek surface of your iPhone.

It looks interesting.. I may have to pick one up…
