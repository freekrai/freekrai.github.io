Google this week released their new augmented reality game called “Ingress”.

The idea behind this game is that the world is covered in Extradimensional Matter, aka XM.. And you are either a member of the enlightened or a member of the resistance..

Your goal is to walk around your town, following maps on your phone and snap pictures of places the phone shows contains XM.. This could be buildings, landmarks, trees, anything..

This may sound cool, but when you think of Google’s reasons behind doing this, you get to see the big picture..

The photos you take around your town, end up in Google Street View. So, essentially, all these gamers, are doing Google’s job of collecting photos and data to make maps better.
