BBC News:

> Samsung complained that the notice posted by Apple was “inaccurate and misleading” because it added comments about other rulings in Germany and the US that had gone in the iPad-maker’s favour.
> 
> “This has received enormous publicity and has perpetuated confusion as to Samsung’s entitlement to market the Galaxy tablet computers in issue,” a Samsung lawyer said in a written statement to judges.
> 
> “It has created the impression that the UK court is out of step with other courts.”
