> The [Google Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/#utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-bkws&utm_medium=ha), the Samsung-built subnotebook designed for the Chrome browser-only OS, appeared on the market about a month ago. As soon as the MacBook Air-lookalike device showed up online, the TUAW newsroom erupted in discussions about whether or not it would make a good low-cost computer.

I’ve had plenty of experience using Apple’s iPad and 11″ MacBook Air, so this smackdown compares the Chromebook, MacBook Air and iPad based on a wide range of criteria. Let’s take a closer look at the Chromebook first.
