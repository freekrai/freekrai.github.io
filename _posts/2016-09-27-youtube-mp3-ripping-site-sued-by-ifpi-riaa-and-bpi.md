> Two weeks ago, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry [published research](https://torrentfreak.com/stream-ripping-problem-worse-than-pirate-sites-ifpi-says-160913/) which claimed that half of 16 to 24-year-olds use stream-ripping tools to copy music from sites like YouTube.
> 
> The industry group said that the problem of stream-ripping has become so serious that in volume terms it had overtaken downloading from ‘pirate’ sites. Given today’s breaking news, the timing of the report was no coincidence.
> 
> Earlier today in a California District Court, a huge coalition of recording labels sued the world’s largest YouTube ripping site. UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Warner Bros, Sony Music, Arista Records, Atlantic Records and several others claim that [YouTube-MP3](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/) (YTMP3), owner Philip Matesanz, and Does 1-10 have infringed their rights.
> 
> “YTMP3 rapidly and seamlessly removes the audio tracks contained in videos streamed from YouTube that YTMP3’s users access, converts those audio tracks to an MP3 format, copies and stores them on YTMP3’s servers, and then distributes copies of the MP3 audio files from its servers to its users in the United States, enabling its users to download those MP3 files to their computers, tablets, or smartphones,” the complaint reads.
> 
> The labels allege that YouTube-MP3 is one of the most popular sites in the entire world and as a result its owner, German-based company PMD Technologies UG, is profiting handsomely from their intellectual property.

I'm actually surprised this service was able to hang on this long before someone sued them.
