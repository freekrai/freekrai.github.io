> Microsoft wants its Surface Book to be a MacBook Pro killer, and while it's too early to say whether it is, it's off to a great start. Like the Surface Pro 3 before it, Microsoft is using magnesium on the Surface Book.
> 
> It's a laptop, but also a tablet. 
> 
> Like most laptops, it has a hinge. Microsoft's hinge is insane. 
> 
> It's like a snake and it folds into place to let you adjust the display viewing angle. The trick of the Surface Book is that everything, apart from the Nvidia graphics chip, is contained within the screen. That means you can hit a button and it magically detaches from the display.

This is an interesting new design from Microsoft, the hinge means they can drop the kickstand that is usually associated with the Surface.
