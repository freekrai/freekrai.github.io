> Most web developers who have viewed their work in an iOS device know that Safari for iOS likes to zoom in on the page and do weird things to font size when you change the device’s orientation from portrait to landscape. A too common way to prevent that is to completely disable the user’s ability to zoom, which you really do not want to do.

I’ve run into this a few times, so this is a handy piece of advice to keep in mind.
