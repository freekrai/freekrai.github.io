> **A hackable text editor for the 21st Century**
> 
> At GitHub, we’re building the text editor we’ve always wanted. A tool you can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first day without ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable, and hackable to the core. We can’t wait to see what you build with it.

Interesting new text editor from the guys at GitHub, currently Mac only with a release for windows promised down the road…
