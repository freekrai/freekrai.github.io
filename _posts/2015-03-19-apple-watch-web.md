Paul Canetti:

> The point is, if Apple announced a computer with no web browser, or a new version of iOS with no web browser, or I don’t know, a new MacBook with no ports, people would freak out. Like the way they freak out about everything Apple has ever removed ever.
> 
> And yet the lack of reaction, or even acknowledgement, that there is no Safari on Apple Watch, leads me to believe that not only is Apple right to not include it, but we are actually ready to accept it: a wearable world with no web browsers.

I don't think Canetti's headline is entirely true - “Apple Watch Doesn’t Have Safari And You Didn’t Even Notice”. 

I noticed, and I'm sure others did too, but already being a Pebble user (which also does not have a web browser), I really didn't give it much thought, it really doesn't make a lot of sense for there to be a web browser on a watch-sized display. 

I think that apps can do what you need on the small screen, and the Pebble has been proving that already.
