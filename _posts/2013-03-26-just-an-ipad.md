I have a conference in Vegas at the end of April that I’m attending, and as I’ve been talking with friends who are also attending, we reach a similar conclusion..

Could I manage the entire week at this conference with just an iPad and a keyboard?

I could code using apps such as Diet Coda or Koder.. I could do some photo editing using PhotoShop Touch.. I can blog using the WordPress app or the Poster app.. I’d have access to email, web, twitter, app.net, skype all from the iPad or my iPhone..

So the question becomes, should I attempt to just bring my iPad and keyboard? or bring my Macbook Air as well just in case? Even though I can foresee the Air spending most of its time in the hotel room rather than being carried around..
