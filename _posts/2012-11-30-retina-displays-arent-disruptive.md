Dana Levine, making a point that the Retina display isn’t a disruptive technology:

> They are a nice-to-have, but not really disruptive to what we already have. When you look at disruptive technologies (as defined in The Innovator’s Dilemma), they typically enable use cases that their predecessors didn’t (such as allowing devices to be smaller or lighter). There isn’t actually any new use case that a retina display enables, other than being prettier. It’s not like visible pixels in any way diminish the functional experience.

I have to agree with Levine.. As great as Retina displays are, they don’t fundamentally change the usability or use-case scenarios of the iPad.
