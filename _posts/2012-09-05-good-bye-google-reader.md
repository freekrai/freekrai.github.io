As I mentioned [a month ago](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/08/06/fever-vs-google-reader), I’ve switched to [fever](http://feedafever.com) instead of Google Reader, and gave it a good month to try out.

Now it’s at a month, and what’s the end result?

Fever wins..

For the same reasons I mentioned in my previous post for switching, it’s stayed as my reader.. I’ve actually managed to not open Google Reader once in the past four weeks.

I’ve used Fluidapp to set up a nice desktop app that notifies me on new articles, and I’m currently using sunstroke for my iPhone reader. I also tried out Reeder and Fever’s own mobile interface, but Sunstroke won by a very narrow margin over Reeder, so it’s really your personal preference.
