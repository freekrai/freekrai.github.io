Fast Company:

> YouTube TV—a streaming service that will offer conventional TV channels streamed across the net to phones, tablets, PCs, and TVs. The company is only saying it will be available in “the coming months.”
> 
> But it’s disclosing most of the other vital facts about what the service will offer, and on paper, at least, they sound like a serious rival to existing services such as Sling TV, DirecTV Now, and PlayStation Vue.
 
This is an interesting announcement, and might be a good deal for some but it's missing a lot of channels that might make it less of a good deal to many.
