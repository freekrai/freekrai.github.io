[![Origami Workstation for iPad and Keyboard](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/media/incase-origami-ipad-stand.png)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004X355Y6/phpprof-20)

If you travel with your iPad often and are in want of a better way to integrate a Bluetooth keyboard, this  
[Origami Workstation](http://goincase.com/products/detail/origami-workstation-cl57934/) from Incase may  
 be just the ticket for you.

When not in use it acts as a cover for your bluetooth keyboard, and then it folds open and creates  
 a “workstation” so you can affix your iPad behind the keyboard. Specially placed hooks and bars keep the keyboard and  
 iPad in place.

I’ve been using this case since last August, and find it very useful for taking my iPad’s usage even further.
