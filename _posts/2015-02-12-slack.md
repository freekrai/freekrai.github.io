Alice Truong, writing for Quartz:

>Slack turns one year old today. In its short but fascinating history, the startup has managed the remarkable feat of actually getting people excited about enterprise communication software. The company has more than 500,000 daily active users, and it’s adding tens of thousands more every each week.

>“That’s our primary metric,” founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield tells Quartz. “If you’re not using Slack every single day, you’re not really using it.”

Slack is a handy tool, we use it internally at [Data McFly](http://datamcfly.com/), as well as with a few other projects I'm involved in.
