Ellis Hamburger writing about why we haven’t seen more app developers supporting iCloud.

> Cloud, perhaps more than any Apple software product, is meant to “just work.” When Apple introduced iCloud, it made clear its hopes to eradicate settings menus and file systems in favor of automation. Steve Jobs pledged to do a better job than he did on MobileMe, Apple’s notoriously horrible stab at web services a few years ago. With iCloud, changes you make to documents on your computer show up instantly on your iPhone and vice versa. “It just works,” Jobs exclaimed [when he first demoed the service](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_C1TZIT-qQ) in 2011. “Everything happens automatically,” Jobs continued, “and it’s really easy to tie your apps into iCloud’s storage system.”

If they couldn’t get iCloud working, who can?”
