It’s been hinted at for months but Google Chrome and Google Drive Apps are now available on the app store for free…

[Google Chrome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823) direct link

Google Chrome looks good and runs just like its Android counterpart. The device syncing is handy to open links you’ve had open on your desktop or other mobile device and should give safari a run for its money.
