Yahoo! just released a new CSS framework called called **[Pure](http://purecss.io/).**  In keeping with it’s name, it’s pure HTML / CSS and doesn’t use any javascript.

The framework is built with responsive layouts in mind and has styles for typography, grids, forms, buttons, tables and navigation.

Markup used is very simple and the whole framework is pretty lightweight(5.7KB minified and gzipped).

Also, it is modular and styles for each module can be used separately
