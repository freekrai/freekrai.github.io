> You may remember a case last year in which the a UK judge overseeing the Samsung vs. Apple case [forced the company to post a public apology on its website](http://www.tuaw.com/2012/07/19/uk-judge-to-make-apple-acknowledge-samsung-didnt-copy-apple/) stating that Samsung did not infringe on Apple’s iPad design. FOSS Patents is reporting today that one of the judges who upheld that bizarre order, [Sir Robin Jacob, is now in the employ of none other than Samsung](http://www.fosspatents.com/2013/02/uk-judge-who-issued-extreme-ruling-for.html).

Who thinks it’s a bit convenient that a judge who ruled against Apple in favour of Samsung, now works for Samsung as an expert witness in another dispute?
