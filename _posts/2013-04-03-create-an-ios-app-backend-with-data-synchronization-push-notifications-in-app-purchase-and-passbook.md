Create An iOS App Backend With Data Synchronization, Push Notifications, In App Purchase And Passbook

With all the news regarding using iCloud for Core Data synchronization, looking at other projects is a good idea.

One such project is Helios, which is built on the Rack webserver interface.

In addition to Core Data synchronization and push notification handling Helios provides in-app purchase management and passbook integration.

The backend is easily set up using the command line interface explained on the Github page. Core Data synchronization is made easy by using AFIncrementalStore.

Here’s an image from the readme showing off the Helios interface:

You can find Helios on [Github here](https://github.com/helios-framework/helios).

A great project for quickly setting up a highly functional web based back-end for an app.
