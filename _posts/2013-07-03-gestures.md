Patrick Rhone:

> I believe Apple should set a standard for what specific gestures should do and what results a customer can expect from them. While I donâ€™t think these should be enforced through the approval process, I do think it should provide developers with a baseline as to what users should expect a gesture to do and that not doing so means you will be working against said expectations and intentions.
