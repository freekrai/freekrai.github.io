Alex Wilhelm, for TheNextWeb:

> If have are running a touch-based Windows 8 machine, you might have noticed that it can be difficult to select certain elements of the operating system, most notably the ones that are not designed for your fingers: Explorer in desktop mode, for example.
> 
> Happily, a new hack has [cropped up on the XDA Forums](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2091867) that is worth your testing. TNW implemented the registry change, and found it to be a positive adaptation, but that could be due to the fatness of our fingers. Your mileage will vary. Specifically, XDA denizens reported improved keyboard response, and better “small item manipulation.”
> 
> However, it is worth trying out. You can find the changes specified below in the following packet. Here are the directions in case you want to implement the new values yourself:
> 
> 
>     Edit key for latency from 8 to 2.
>     Edit sample time from 8 to 2
>     Restart

> Users in the thread have reported that the hack will result in decreased battery life, as Windows 8 has to ping the touchscreen more often. If you are a Surface owner, you have enough battery power to make it through, I would guess.
