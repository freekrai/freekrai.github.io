> As rumored, Apple has announced a refresh for its MacBook Airs today at WWDC, its annual developers conference. The new systems feature the same (near-perfect) chassis first introduced in 2010, and they’ll be available in both 11.6- and 13.3-inch variants, as before. The primary change is upgraded silicon: Apple is using Intel’s latest processors, known as Haswell, which promise vastly improved battery life and some boosts to integrated graphics performance.

> With the new processors, Apple is promising 12 hours of battery life for the 13-inch model, and 9 hours for the 11-inch version, a significant upgrade from the seven hours and five hours quoted, respectively, for last year’s models. The new silicon is also said to bring a 40 percent increase in graphics performance. As is par for the course, Apple hasn’t specified which specific processors will be available, but Core i5 and i7 ultra-low voltage models are going to be available with Intel HD Graphics 5000. Other than the new power plant, there are some other changes to the MacBook Air. The new models have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and flash storage is said to be up to 45 percent faster than the last generation.
