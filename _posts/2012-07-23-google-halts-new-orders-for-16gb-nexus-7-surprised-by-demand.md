> Sources close to Google say the search giant seriously underestimated the demand for the 16GB version of its 7in Nexus 7 tablet, which has sold out from stockists and other sources while demand for the smaller 8GB version remains comparatively low.

Not a bad problem to have. And it makes sense, the Nexus 7 is a great device.

Interesting enough, the 16GB is also the only model currently being sold by retailers.
