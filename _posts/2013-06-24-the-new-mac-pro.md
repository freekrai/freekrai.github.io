Guy English:

> It fascinates me because it’s fundamentally new. There’s only one CPU socket and it bets heavily on the bus and GPU performance. While this looks to software to be just another Mac, it isn’t. It’s capabilities aren’t traditional.

The new Mac Pro’s success will depend on how well software is able to take advantage of its GPU-heavy architecture.
