Microsoft is officially ceasing production of the Xbox 360.

> Xbox 360 means a lot to everyone in Microsoft. And while weâ€™ve had an amazing run, the realities of manufacturing a product over a decade old are starting to creep up on us. Which is why we have made the decision to stop manufacturing new Xbox 360 consoles. We will continue to sell existing inventory of Xbox 360 consoles, with availability varying by country.

If you compare the lifecycle of a game console to, say, an iPhone or an iPad, you see something interesting. 

We've gotten so used to replacing those devices every few years, and our computer perhaps every three to five. 

Whereas, my 2006 Xbox 360 was still in active use until it found itself replaced by the Xbox One, especially with the recent addition of backwards compatibility for many 360 games. A friend still has my old Xbox 360 and it works great.

The Xbox 360 had a great run though.
