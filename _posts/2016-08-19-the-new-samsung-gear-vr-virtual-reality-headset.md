[![The New Samsung Gear VR Virtual Reality Headset](/media/gearvr.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2bsIxz8 )


Samsung has released a new Gear VR headset. There aren't a lot of differences, but the differences they have made are nice.

First, they've changed the color from white to a blueish-black color, then they made it lighter, you can actually wear it longer and not get a headache.

The darker color also keeps light from leaking in so it's a better feel overall.

Next, they changed the trackpad on the side to make it into more a touch pad you have on your laptop, rather than the previous design. Another change is a home button beside the back button, so you can exit apps quicker.

But, the big change is that they've given it a wider view, a while 110 degrees wider view. This is the change that makes it easier to use, when combined with the thicker, more comfortable foam around the eyes and the darker color. This all helps to make it more immersive, and lets you watch it longer.

The other change is they've switched the charging port to a USB-C port to accommodate the cable for the Note 7, they've also made a switchable dongle to swap out micro-USB or USB-C adapters to plug your phone into the Gear.

Don't worry, there's also an adapter for the USB-c charging port to use Micro-USB but the significant feature here is that this port also support data and not just charging, so this can open things up to plugging in controllers and motion controllers down the road.

#### Is it worth switching if you already have a Gear VR headset?

That is a good question, while the extra 110 degrees of view does make it a nicer experience over all, it really depends on how hardcore you are into using your Gear VR already.  The future potential [motion controller](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10727852/samsung-rink-motion-controllers-gear-vr-ces-2016) support does really make this more promising than the previous model though, and I still recommend some sort of controller for most of the games.
