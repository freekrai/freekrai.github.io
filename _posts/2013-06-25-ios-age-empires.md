Jeff Blagdon, writing for The Verge:

> Microsoft is bringing its games to iOS and Android, beginning with *Age of Empires *sometime in 2013, [reports Japan’s *Nikkei* business daily](http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASDD240H8_U3A620C1MM8000/?dg=1). The ports are coming courtesy of mobile developer KLab, which is licensing the games from Microsoft for global distribution. *Nikkei* calls it a possible indication of a turning point in the gaming market, speculating that the move could even affect the mobile strategies of competitors Sony and Nintendo.

About time, I’ve been waiting for Age of Empires to come to iOS for 5 years…
