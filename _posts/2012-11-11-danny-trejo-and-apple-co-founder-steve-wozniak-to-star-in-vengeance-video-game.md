Michael Mcwhertor, writing for Polygon:

> Action movie star and veteran tough guy Danny Trejo, star of Robert Rodriguez’s Machete, will appear in a mobile game alongside Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak titled Danny Trejo’s Vengeance: Woz With A Coz. The game, for unspecified tablets, is reportedly due for release by Nov. 22.
