After two years, the iWatch is here… Or at least it will be early next year…

> The Apple Watch will come in two distinct sizes — 1.5 inches and 1.65 inches — with multiple color and style options for each. Pricing begins at $349, but it won’t go on sale until early next year.

I think I currently prefer my Pebble.. The iWatch is too much like the old iPod Nano watch, but I may change my mind when it actually comes out in a few months..
