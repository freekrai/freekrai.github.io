> Lots of frontend web developers have been getting interested in dynamic interfaces using motion effects. This is all too common with many advancements within popular JavaScript libraries. But there has also been a lot of interest in CSS3 animated effects.
> 
> One such library is called [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/ "Animate.css") which was created by Dan Eden. You can find a lot of great information on the website and usage is very well documented. In this article I want to present a few miscellaneous UI effects which may be applied into typical website layouts. Keep in mind that although Animate.css can make CSS3 animations, it cannot handle binding to specific effects such as clicks or keystrokes. Because of this limitation I will be coupling a bit of jQuery code along with the CSS classes and demonstrating how this comes together in an organized fashion.
