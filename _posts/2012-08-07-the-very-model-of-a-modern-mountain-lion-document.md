Matt Neuburg:

> In the recently released OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple has done something I thought they’d never do: they backtracked – sort of. They heeded the objections of users to a major feature of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, and took steps to meet those objections. They didn’t remove the feature – that, I suppose, would be asking too much – but they changed the interface and provided an increased range of user choices and capabilities.

> In this article, I’ll sketch out how Mountain Lion is different from Lion with regard to this feature, and why, therefore, I personally like Mountain Lion much more than Lion.

A pretty detailed treatment of some very significant changes to document handling in Mountain Lion.
