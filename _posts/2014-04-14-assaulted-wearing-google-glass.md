Kyle Russell:

> On Friday night, I was assaulted while walking down the sidewalk in the Mission District of San Francisco.
> 
> A colleague and I had just finished [covering a march in protest of a Google employee](http://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-eviction-protest-2014-4) who had recently evicted several tenants after buying and moving into a home in the area.
> 
> After more than an hour spent working on the story in a coffee shop, I arranged my laptop, camera, and notes in my backpack. Mindlessly, I put on Google Glass instead of squeezing it in with the rest of my things.
> 
> (In retrospect, I can see how that might not have been the best idea.)
> 
> The aforementioned colleague and I were on our way to the 16th Street BART station — I’ll note that I wasn’t using any device at the time — when a person put their hand on my face and yelled, “Glass!”
> 
> In an instant the person was sprinting away, Google Glass in hand.
