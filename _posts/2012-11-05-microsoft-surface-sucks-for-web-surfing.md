Mark Hattersley for Macworld UK:

> Independent benchmark tests by Futuremark have revealed that Microsoft’s Surface tablet is surprisingly slow at web browsing.
> 
> When run through the Peacekeeper: Universal Browser Test, the Microsoft Surface speed test came out at just 348, almost third of the result from the new Apple iPad 4′s score of 951.
> 
> The Surface also scored slower than the Apple iPad mini (515), Nexus 7 (489) and even last year’s Apple iPhone 4S model (438). In fact, the Microsoft Surface only just beat the Eee Pad Transformer Prime (344).
