James Gowans:

> Does iOS ship with everything you need out of the box?

To try and  answer that question, he has been using his iPhone with only five non-stock apps, two of which are built by Apple. Again, Gowans:

> And maybe that’s the real reason behind all of this: the less time I spend trying out some new or improved app, the less time I spend tinkering with settings or worrying if Dropbox or iCloud is the better synching solution, the less time I can spend with my eyes glued to a 3″ glowing rectangle, means more time I can spend doing things that really matter. Like writing an essay, building a fort with my kids, or enjoying a glass (bottle) of wine (whiskey) with my wife. It’s that simple.

Makes sense..
