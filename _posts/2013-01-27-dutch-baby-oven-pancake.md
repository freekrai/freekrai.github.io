Tried this today for breakfast, and it was delicious :)

> **Ingredients**
> 
> 1. Pancake - 4 eggs
> - 1 cup 1% milk
> - 1 cup sifted white whole wheat flour
> - 2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar
> - ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
> - ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
> - 1/8 teasoon kosher salt
> - 1/4 cup unsalted butter
> 2. Finishing - 1 ½ cups Driscoll’s Blueberries, rinsed and dried
> - 2 blood oranges, peeled and diced
> - Confectioners’ sugar
> - Maple syrup
> 
> **Instructions**
> 
> 1. Heat oven to 475F (245 degrees C). Place a 12-inch ovenproof skillet (cast iron or other) in oven and allow skillet to heat for 5 minutes. Add butter to skillet and allow butter to melt in hot skillet in oven.
> 2. While butter is melting, add eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, nutmeg and salt to a blender. Whirl for 30 or so seconds until well blended. (Or you may whisk ingredients in a mixing bowl instead of the blender.)
> 3. Check on butter in skillet in oven; it should be melted and foamy. Allow butter to brown slightly if you like; otherwise, proceed.
> 4. Remove skillet from oven, swirl butter to entirely coat bottom and sides of skillet, reduce oven heat to 425F (220 degrees C). Pour batter in the skillet and return skillet to oven. Set timer for 20 minutes.
> 5. Make berry topping: While pancake is baking, add blueberries and blood oranges to a bowl and stir gently to combine. Set aside.
> 6. Bake pancake until puffed and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Edges of pancake will rise high, followed minutes later by the center; it will be delightfully puffy! When done, remove from oven promptly and sprinkle with a bit of powdered sugar if you like.
> 7. Pancake will deflate when you cut it. Cut into 4 portions and serve, topping with blueberry-orange mixture. Pass the maple syrup and additional confectioner’s sugar at the table, for those who like a sweeter breakfast. (I like the pancake as-is with fruit topping; my family prefers it sweeter.)
