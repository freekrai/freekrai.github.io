Jason Snell:

> Unfortunately, I fear that tech-industry observers have completely lost their perspective. As [Rene has written](http://www.imore.com/there-wont-be-another-iphone-not-apple-not-anyone-not-long-time-yet), no matter how big the wearables market gets, it’s still not going to touch the smartphone market.
> 
> IDC reported that in 2013, one billion smartphones were shipped, up 38 percent from the previous year. That’s a fast-growing market worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Meanwhile, on Thursday IDC predicted that the wearables market will reach 112 million units in 2018.
> 
> In other words, in four years the wearables market might grow to be one-tenth the size of today’s smartphone market — in units shipped. Presumably the average selling price of wearable items will be a fraction of that of smartphones, meaning the dollar value of the wearables market is even more minuscule compared to the smartphone market.

The big issue with wearables is pricing… The fact that iPhones are currently subsidized by carriers really blinds many people to the actual cost of the phones at $700 – 800 a pop.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I actually think it’s much more likely that any new wearable devices from Apple will be priced more along the line of iPods: in the $100-400 range.</span>
