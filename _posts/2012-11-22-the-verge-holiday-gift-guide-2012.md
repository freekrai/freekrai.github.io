It’s that time of year again, and The Verge has posted a gift guide for nearly every possible category..

> Did you hear that? That low hum rising off in the distance? What could it be? Oh, of course, it’s *The Verge* Holiday Gift Guide!
> 
> The holiday shopping season — and deep dread of finding that *perfect* gift for everyone on your list — kicks off now, and we’re here to help.
> 
> This year, we’re offering up four big lists, ranging from a hand-curated mix of home, design, and art picks to truly extravagant lifts for those that have everything.
> 
> And a mix of great books, movies, and thoughtful, affordable gifts. Drawing on the expertise in the office, we’ve also broken down the best picks at different prices across categories, so you’ll have no problem finding the right phone, camera, TV, or laptop this holiday season.
