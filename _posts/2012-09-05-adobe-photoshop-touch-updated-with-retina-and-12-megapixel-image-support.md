> Keeping in line with its plans to add Retina display support for “key products,” Adobe has released an update to Photoshop Touch that optimizes the app for Apple’s third-generation iPad. Version 1.3 also allows both Android and iOS users to create and edit images with a resolution of up to 12-megapixels, though due to performance limitations, the iPad 2 is limited to 10-megapixel images. Other new features include language support for Brazilian and Russian, new Shred and Colorize effects, a new three-finger tap gesture to toggle between zoom views, and various bug fixes. The app is available for $9.99 in the iTunes App Store and on Google Play, while existing users can update for free. As for the remainder of its software suite, Adobe has promised that Retina updates will be available before the end of the year.
