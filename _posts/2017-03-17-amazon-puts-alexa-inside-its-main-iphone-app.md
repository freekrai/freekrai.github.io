VentureBeat:

> Starting today and available to all iPhone users next week, you can talk to Amazonâ€™s intelligent assistant Alexa while using the Amazon app.
> 
> Naturally, the voice assistant is able to shop and track packages, but it can also do most of the things Alexa can do, like tell a joke, give weather updates, and predict the Best Picture at the Academy Awards or the winner of the Super Bowl. It also plays music, controls Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, and grants Amazon app users access to more than 10,000 skills.

Some people will portray this as Amazon `taking on Siri`, but since Alexa is buried inside the Amazon app, it probably won't affect Siri usage one bit.

It's like using Google Assistant on the iPhone now vs using Siri. If there's too many options needed to do something, people will usually choose the option that's easiest.
