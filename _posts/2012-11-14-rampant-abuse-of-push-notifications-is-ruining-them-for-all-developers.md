> The abuse of push notifications is spreading across the App Store. As a result, users are starting to reflexively reject app requests to send push notifications.

I couldn’t agree more. Some of the uses of push notifications have gotten way out of hand…

When clients want to include push notifications in an app, I sit them down, give them the “talk” about how easy it is to abuse push notifications, and then make sure that if we have to use them, we only push what is absolutely necessary, such as reminders, content updates, or notifying of a background task being completed. Nobody wants their phone filling with notifications about useless items.

Myself, I only enable push notifications on apps on my iPhone or iPad that I think need it, otherwise, I turn them off.
