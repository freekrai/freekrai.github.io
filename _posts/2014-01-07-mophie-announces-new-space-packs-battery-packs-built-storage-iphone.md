> Mophie followed up its Juice Pack line of battery cases today by officially announcing the Mophie Space Pack. The pair of battery packs promise to not only double the battery life of you iPhone 5 or 5S, but also double your device’s storage capacity at the same time.

This was a matter of time… There are several companies making hard drives for iOS devices, so it was only a matter of time that Mophie or a similar battery pack maker started packaging storage inside their batteries.

One less thing to carry around…
