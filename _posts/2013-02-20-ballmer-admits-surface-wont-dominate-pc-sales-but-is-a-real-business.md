> After describing Surface as a “design point” to “[prime the pump](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/18/3095910/steve-ballmer-on-microsoft-surface-we-want-to-prime-the-pump)” and “[sell a few million](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/10/3148570/steve-ballmer-microsoft-surface-sales-estimates),” Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is describing the company’s tablets as a “real business” this week. In a brief [interview with *MIT technology Review*](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/511076/steve-ballmer-on-the-strategy-behind-his-strangest-product/), Ballmer avoids answering Surface sales questions, but says he’s “super-glad” Microsoft did the Surface as it’s important for the Windows ecosystem. “Surface is a real business,” says Ballmer. “In an environment in which there’s 350 million PCs sold, I don’t think Surface is going to dominate volume, but it’s a real business.”
