Pulse, the news reader for iOS and Android devices has finally made its way to the desktop thanks to a new HTML5 web app..

This is an interesting move on their behalf, where instead of doing like Reeder did with a desktop app, they decided to do web app instead.

Combine this with the use of [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) and you get a desktop app pretty easily..
