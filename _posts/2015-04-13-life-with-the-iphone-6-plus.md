Marco Arment recently went through the same choice many of us have faced over the past few months, deciding between an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 6 Plus.

> After months of ignoring Myke Hurley telling us that the iPhone 6 Plus was great, a bunch of my friends have all tried it recently, and many have converted. See these podcasts:

I wanted to get a local SIM, and my only unlocked iPhones were my old 5S and the 6 Plus I bought for development and testing that has sat mostly idle for months. I didn’t want the 5S’ worse camera and smaller battery, so I chose the 6 Plus.

I actually made the switch a couple months ago myself after being an iPhone 6 user since the iPhone 6 was released. I had played with the 6 and 6 Plus before, and when the chance to switch came, I took it, and haven't looked back since.

The 6 Plus' screen size affords me opportunity close to the iPad Mini, and the battery life is handy when your working all day. I've actually even paired it with the [Logitech To Go portable keyboard](http://amzn.to/1Eu3zDY) for when I want to use the iPhone 6 Plus for writing off the on-screen keyboard for things such as this blog post.
