> Hank is a lowly class three henchmen in the Union of Evil. It’s not how he pictured his career, but as he says, “you just play the cards you’re dealt.” When Hank is forced to train an excitable young dreamer, he offers the same trite poker metaphor. Instead, the boy steals an amazing super suit, changing everything.
> 
>  Hank enlists a woman from his past, Jolene, to help extricate the Kid from suit. Soon, the Kid has fled, and worse, Jolene has been kidnapped. Worst of all, Hank has realized he is in love. Now Hank must break his “risk nothing” code, to save the boy he’s befriended, the woman he loves, and the entire free world!
