> A small fire broke out today at a Samsung-related factory responsible for producing batteries for none other than the Galaxy Note 7. [According to _Reuters_](http://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-sdi-batteries-fire-idUSL4N1FT3BX), the fire started in a waste facility and was caused by products including faulty batteries. The fire was reportedly extinguished before it could cause any substantial delays or harm to the factory. Samsung said that no one was killed.
> 
> The factory, Samsung SDI, was one of two that made batteries for the Note 7, according to _Reuters_. The Note 7, of course, quickly became infamous when units of the device [began catching fire because of battery issues](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/22/14353686/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-reason-report).
> 
> There’s apparently some confusion about how the fire actually started. Samsung SDI said it happened in a waste facility, but a local fire department said it began inside “production workshops.” The fire department says it sent 110 firefighters and 19 trucks to deal with the fire.
