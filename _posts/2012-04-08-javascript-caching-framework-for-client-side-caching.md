Interesting framework…

> JavaScript caching framework for client side caching in the browser using localStorage. With a memcache inspired API usage is very easy and familiar. locache has no dependencies and is very small.
> 
> locache gracefully degrades when the browser doesn’t support localStorage. Usually this will be IE6 or IE7, you wont get any errors, but caching attempts will be silently dropped and lookups will always appear to be a cache miss.
