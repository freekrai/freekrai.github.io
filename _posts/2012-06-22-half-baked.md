Michael Mulvey on Microsoft’s Surface event:

> But the solid hardware isn’t what has me perplexed. It’s the complete lack of software demonstrations. It’s ironic, isn’t it? Here’s a company that has made billions of dollars selling software for over 30 years, and when it comes time to debut the device launching them into the future, they don’t bother to allocate even a few minutes to showing off how well software runs on it?
> 
> No games. No movies. No software. All we got was a 2 second glimpse of a custom Twitter Netflix application and a glitchy Internet Explorer.
> 
> What about the ecosystem? The companies and people outside of Microsoft? What about getting a bunch (hell, even a few) developers and content providers in early on so you have great things to showcase on your product?
