Apple has announced the long awaited iPad Mini with Retina Display today.

The new iPad Mini also features the recent A7 processor, the same processor as the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air.

Interestingly enough, the original iPad Mini will continue to be sold at a slightly reduced price, while the iPad Mini with Retina gets a price bump.

This is along the same lines as the decision to keep the iPad 2 for sale while continuing to update the iPad line since the iPad 3 was released last year.
