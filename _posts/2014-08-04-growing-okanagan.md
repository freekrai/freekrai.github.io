![Growing up Okanagan](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ksurf.jpg "Growing up Okanagan")

I live in the Okanagan valley in British Columbia, more specifically in Penticton.

This area is interesting as we are surrounded by mountains on two sides and lakes on the other sides. The end result is most kids grow up skiing in the winter, and hitting the lake in the summer. We have Lake Okanagan on one side, and Skaha Lake on the other side, both with sandy beaches that are groomed daily.

The picture above is my daughter, as she suits up to spend a day out on the lake on her body board, her new favourite summer hobby, along with a dozen or so other kids all doing the same thing.
