Interesting read if you hav any interest in iphone game design…

> I have found that interface design is one of the toughest parts of creating agame. With so many different screens, and so little screen space, every pixel needs to be thought through.
> 
> We have recently redesigned the entire interface for our upcoming game, because we realized the user experience simply did not work as we intended.
> 
> There was too much information on screen at one time, and without a clear focus, people did not understand what they were looking at.
> 
> People looked at the screen for about 1 second, then clicked on the “Next” button and started the next level. In other words: The interface simply did not do its job.
