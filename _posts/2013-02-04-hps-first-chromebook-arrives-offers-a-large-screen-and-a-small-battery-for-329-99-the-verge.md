Sean Hollister, for The Verge:

> [The leaks were all true](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924524/hp-first-chromebook-revealed-in-leaked-spec-sheet): Following [Samsung](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/24/3549368/samsung-chromebook-review-series-3), [Acer](http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/29/3702668/acer-c7-chromebook-review-199-laptop), and [Lenovo](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/17/3886142/lenovo-enters-chromebook-market-with-thinkpad-x131e), HP has decided to build a laptop running Google’s Chrome OS operating system. It’s called the HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook, and its distinguishing characteristic is right there in the name: unlike the first wave of Chromebooks with 11.6-inch and 12-inch screens, the Pavilion 14 has a 14-inch 1366 x 768 panel, and a correspondingly large laptop frame. HP hopes the larger keyboard and more spacious experience will contribute to improved ease of use. There’s also a correspondingly larger array of ports, including three USB 2.0 sockets and an SD card slot so you can expand the included (tiny) 16GB of solid state storage should you so choose.

One more company jumping into the Chromebook market.. Could be interesting as this grows..
