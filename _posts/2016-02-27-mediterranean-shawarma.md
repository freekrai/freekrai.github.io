![Mediterranean Shawarma](http://rogerstringer.com/media/shawarma.jpg)

Shawarma is one of my favourite foods, but there is a lack of good places to get decent shawarma around here so I make my own.

I probably take it a step further with my own Tzatiki, so if you prefer to buy your own, you can skip steps 2 and 3.

### What you need

- Tzatiki
   - 2/3 cup greek yogurt
   - 1 1/2 tsp olive oil
   - tsp lemon juice
   - 1 garlic clove
- 1/2 cucumber, grated
- 1 tsp fresh dill, chopped
-  2 pieces (60 g) naan bread
- 1 small tomato, sliced horizontally
- 1/2 red onion, sliced horizontally
- x2 5.5 oz (150 g each) beef steaks
- salt + pepper to taste

### How to make it

1. Place a frying pan on your stove and turn it on to warm up. 
2. In a blender, combine the yogurt, oil, the lemon juice, and the garlic. 
3. Once they’re well combined, mix the grated cucumber and most of the dill into the mixture by hand – that’s your Tzatiki. 
4. Season and cook the steaks – heating each side for upwards of 3 minutes depending on how well done you’d like it to be. 
5. Let the steaks sit a little while, then spread the Tzatiki on the breads, place each steak on top of the bread, top with a few slices of tomato and red onion and sprinkle the remaining dill on top. Enjoy
