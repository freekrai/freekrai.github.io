> Spotify, which was created in Stockholm 10 years ago, now boasts of having close to 100 million users in more than 59 markets, despite increasing competition and, so far, a lack of profits.

Spotify claims it has 30 million paid users compared to Appleâ€™s 13 million. Both Apple and Spotify say they are growing, so the users are coming from other services, or they are new to streaming.
