> It seems like another era, but back in the â€™00s, major new-cat-name updates of Mac OS X were a big deal. They were packed with major new features, new built-in apps, significant performance improvements, and often sported refreshed system-wide UI appearances (the long slow fading out of the 10.0 horizontal stripes; the meteoric rise and ignominious demise of our old friend Brushed Metal). We waited in line at Apple Stores to buy them.

Interesting reading from Gruber as he weighs in on Mountain Lion compared to previous versions of Mac OS X..
