<div style="text-align:center">![](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/media/ipadkickstand.jpg)</div>> To go along with the recent images of the original iPhone 4 prototype we reported on today, The Verge uncovered a trove of early iPad and iPhone prototype images from the Samsung vs Apple legal documents. At one point Apple was seriously considering an integrated kickstand for the iPad, kind of like the Microsoft Surface.

Interesting to see what the iPad and iPhone prototypes looked like and what the end product looks like now..
