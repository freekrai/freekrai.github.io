> Microsoft has reaffirmed that its Surface for Windows RT tablet will go on sale at the same time as Windows 8. In an SEC filing, spotted by CNET, the software maker confirms an October 26th launch date. “The next version of our operating system, Windows 8, will be generally available on October 26, 2012. At that time, we will begin selling the Surface, a series of Microsoft-designed and manufactured hardware devices.”
