I just pushed an update to the jQuery Mobile Starter Kit..

This update introduces ios.css, android.css, ios.js and android.js so you can have unique rules depending on the devices..

This also integrates the [scrolling fix](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/08/12/faster-android-scrolling) I posted a couple days ago for Android devices running jQuery Mobile, so that it makes scrolling faster..

The reason I added a seperate js and css file for each device is that you may not want or need to integrate the same fix for different devices..

Also, sometimes there may be other styling changes you want to make for different devices, so now you can easier. :)
