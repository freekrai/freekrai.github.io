> The FBI has arrested a suspect in the case involving 3,600 stolen iPad minis from JFK airport in New York, reports the [*New York Post*](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jfk_airhead_busted_in_ipad_heist_zCVuIAxuJJkSjovrJ6yXLO). The stolen iPads, now valued at $1.9 million, were apparently [taken from a JFK cargo building with a forklift last Monday](http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3649246/ipad-mini-jfk-airport-heist). Agents were able to track down the suspect when other employees of the airport came forward and said that he had inquired about the shipment of iPads and where he could obtain forklifts.
