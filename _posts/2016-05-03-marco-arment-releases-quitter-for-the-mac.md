> Quitter is a Mac app that automatically hides or quits apps after periods of inactivity, inspired by my [Automatic Social Discipline](https://marco.org/2015/10/30/automatic-social-discipline) method. Itâ€™s great for minimizing distraction from social apps like Twitter and Slack, news readers, or even your email app.

Quitter looks interesting, I have it running currently and it's been nice to be able to add the various rules to it.
