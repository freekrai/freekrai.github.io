Casey Newton, writing for The Verge:

> On a rainy morning this week in San Francisco, newly appointed Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich sat down for coffee with one of the people calling for his resignation. Hampton Catlin, a [prominent developer](http://www.teamrarebit.com/) of apps for the nascent Firefox OS, announced he was abandoning the platform due to Eich’s handling of the disclosure that in 2008 he [donated $1,000](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/04/business/la-fi-tn-brendan-eich-prop-8-contribution-20120404) to the fight against same-sex marriage. California’s Proposition 8, which passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008, made same-sex marriage illegal in California until the law was overturned by the Supreme Court. Over the course of an hour, Catlin explained the suffering that Prop. 8 caused for him and his partner, a Brit who couldn’t immigrate until marriage became legal. Catlin asked Eich for an apology. He didn’t get one.

> Instead, Eich [resigned as CEO](http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/3/5578984/mozilla-ceo-resigns-amid-controversy-over-donation-to-anti-gay) and stepped down from the board of the Mozilla foundation. “Mozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didn’t live up to it,” the company’s executive chairwoman, Mitchell Baker, said in [a blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/) today. “We know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: it’s because we haven’t stayed true to ourselves.” Suddenly Eich, who formerly served as Mozilla’s chief technical officer and previously invented the programming language JavaScript, was out of a company he co-founded in 1998. “It may be challenging for a CEO, but everyone in our community can have different beliefs about all sorts of things that may be in conflict,” Eich [told *CNET*](http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-ceo-gay-marriage-firestorm-could-hurt-firefox-cause-q-a/) earlier in the week. But the challenge proved greater than his leadership.

This was a good move on Eich’s part, and shows exactly what a focused Internet can do…
