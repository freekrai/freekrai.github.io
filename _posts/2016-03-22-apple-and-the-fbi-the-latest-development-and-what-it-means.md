Alina Selyukh, writing for NPR, lays out a series of questions about the latest development in Apple vs FBI.

> The FBI may have found a new way to crack into the locked iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters â€” a method that doesn't require Apple's help.
> 
> This is a major new development in the increasingly heated debate between the tech giant and the government, which has argued that Apple should be compelled to write new special software that would override some security features.
> 
> That was the only way, investigators previously had said, that they could crack the phone's passcode without jeopardizing its contents.
