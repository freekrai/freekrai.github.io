I came across this remote recently when I was trying to make listening to music in my car via my iPhone more enjoyable..

You don’t want to have to reach for your phone to change music everytime, so I decided to find a good bluetooth soluton.

The Satechi Bluetooth Remote for the iPhone ended up being the perfect solution, and you can even use it to take pictures with the camera app from up to 30 feet away.

It’s nice that I can leave it in my car, and have it automatically connect to my phone when I get in, then use it to skip songs as I drive, and since I spend nearly 2 hours in my car each day, having that control is very handy.
