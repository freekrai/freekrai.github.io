John Siracusa:

> After a dozen years and nine major releases, OS X has had a full life: the [exuberance of youth](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2001/04/macos-x/), gradually [maturing](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/04/macosx-10-4/) into [adulthood](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/), and now, perhaps, entering its [dotage](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/). [When I am an old operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Joseph) I shall wear… [leather](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/5/#ical)?
> 
> The 2011 release of [OS X 10.7 Lion](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/) seemed to mark the natural endpoint of the “big cat” naming scheme. But Apple couldn’t resist the lure of the “[cat](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/), [*modifier* cat](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/)” naming pattern, releasing [OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/) a year later. Perhaps it just wanted to give its cat nine lives.
> 
> The 10th major release, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, is named after an awkwardly plural [California surfing spot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavericks_(location)), finally ending the feline dynasty. But what part of the operating system’s existence is this? The afterlife?

It wouldn’t be an OS X upgrade without the annual deep dive review from Sircasua…
