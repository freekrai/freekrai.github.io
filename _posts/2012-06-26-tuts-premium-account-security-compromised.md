> Today we learned that the Tuts+ Premium server was compromised, and sensitive data including email addresses and passwords were accessed before we were able to detect and stop the unauthorized intrusion.

In light of LinkedIn’s recent password issue a couple weeks ago, this is something everyone needs to start seriously considering and thinking about…

This is why I like using services such as 1password that can create a password for you, as long as you don’t accidentally nuke 1password and lose all that data..
