An Apple advertisement airing on major networks tonight uses an alternative-rock classic to promote a new tagline for the iPhone 5S. A crowdsourced version of the Pixies’ “[Gigantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIu_b_fG_2g)” plays in the ad, which unveils a new tagline: “You’re more powerful than you think.”

The ad itself shows off the iPhone’s content creation features — music is a major part of the commercial, but gaming, photography, videography, and even a language translation app are also highlighted. You can watch the commercial below.
