This is [exactly the kind of story you’d expect from Federico Viticci at MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/stories/life-after-cancer-how-the-iphone-helped-me-achieve-a-healthier-lifestyle/): Long, personal, and somehow also a deep dive into some of the best health apps for iOS.

Federico was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in 2011 and the disease and its treatment took its toll. Health that he took for granted before then was gone. And he used his iPhone to help him eat better and exercise more.

> Stupidly enough, because I thought that “I was okay”, I fell into my old habits of careless eating, no exercise, and a sedentary lifestyle. If cancer couldn’t kill me, did McDonald’s really have a chance?
> 
> Seriously: how stupid was I - after all I had gone through, ignoring the wellness of my body just because I was done with treatments? If anything, my experiences should have taught me about the importance of taking care of myself, so I could be well and spend time with the people I love and doing the things I care about.

Definitely worth a read.

I have my own struggles as an insulin dependent diabetic, and I've been working towards getting healthier using some similar apps, and while cancer and diabetes are completely different stories, getting healthier is important in all aspects.
