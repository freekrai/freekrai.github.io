Jordan Robertson, writing for Bloomberg’s Tech Blog:

> While many major technology vendors have overcome their reluctance to making a public showing at the conference, Apple, now the world’s most valuable company, has had no problem snubbing a community whose aim is to unearth its vulnerabilities.
> 
> That will change Thursday when Dallas De Atley, manager of Apple’s platform security team, is scheduled to give a presentation on key security technologies within iOS, the operating system for iPhones and iPads. Trey Ford, Black Hat’s general manager, said it will be the first time an Apple representative has taken the stage at Black Hat or its sibling conference, DefCon.

Smart move on Apple’s part.
