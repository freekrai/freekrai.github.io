> I’ve been looking around for good ways to store information for a PhoneGap application I’m working on. I think that the PhoneGap SQL  
>  APIs may still be the best bet but I also wanted to check out some of the more unique storage options. One of the options I came  
>  across was Lawnchair, by Brian Leroux. One of the beautiful things about Lawnchair is that it’s incredibly simple.
> 
> It does persistent JSON storage, has adapters for different storage options (localstorage, webSQL, etc) and is very lightweight. One  
>  of the not-fun things about Lawnchair is that it’s incredibly simple. While I found it easy to use (mostly) there were some areas  
>  that didn’t work. I think part of the issue is that I don’t have a lot of experience with NoSQL solutions like CouchDB (where  
>  Lawnchair draws a lot of its inspiration) so I think a lot of the issue lies with me.
