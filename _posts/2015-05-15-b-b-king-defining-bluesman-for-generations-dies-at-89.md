From the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/arts/music/b-b-king-blues-singer-dies-at-89.html):

> “Growing up on the plantation there in Mississippi, I would work Monday through Saturday noon,” he said. “I’d go to town on Saturday afternoons, sit on the street corner, and I’d sing and play.
> 
> “I’d have me a hat or box or something in front of me. People that would request a gospel song would always be very polite to me, and they’d say: ‘Son, you’re mighty good. Keep it up. You’re going to be great one day.’ But they never put anything in the hat.
> 
> “But people that would ask me to sing a blues song would always tip me and maybe give me a beer. They always would do something of that kind. Sometimes I’d make 50 or 60 dollars one Saturday afternoon. Now you know why I’m a blues singer.”

And from the [BBC News obituary](http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-15575668):

> It was while playing in one of the clubs that a fight broke out over a woman, causing a fire. After rushing out of the wooden building, he realised that he had left his guitar behind.
> 
> He risked his life by going back in to rescue his instrument. He named it after the woman whose charms had been behind the trouble: Lucille.
