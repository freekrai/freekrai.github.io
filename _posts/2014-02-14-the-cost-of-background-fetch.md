David Smith wrote an interesting post about how one of iOS 7′s most important features can unexpectedly increase costs for developers, as data is more frequently requested in the background.

> My first example of this was when I added Background Fetch to Check the Weather. A weather app’s primary function is displaying up-to-the-minute, constantly changing data so in my initial iOS 7 update I experimented with adding highly frequent background updates. The result was far more dramatic than I’d expected.
