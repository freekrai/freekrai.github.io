Handy tutorial for those who want to delve into designing iPhone UI in photoshop…

> In this tutorial we’re going to be designing an iPhone user interface for a forum and chat based mobile application.
> 
> The app involves a handful of everyday touch interface elements, such as buttons, input fields and touch gestures.
> 
> We will be covering various Photoshop tools, layer styles and of course tackling any design constraints; as well making the design pixel-perfect and beautiful enough to be worthy of a place on an iPhone screen.
> 
> The design was put together using Photoshop CS5.5, however all recent versions of Photoshop will work wonderfully.
