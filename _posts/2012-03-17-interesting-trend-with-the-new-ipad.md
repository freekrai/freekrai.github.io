I’ve noticed an interesting trend this weekend with the launch of the latest iPad from Apple..

They haven’t been selling out..

Normally, the chances of finding an iPad on launch day are slim as they sell out their limited quantities, but this weekend,  
 the new iPad hasn’t been selling out.

What’s the one difference? Apple hasn’t discontinued the iPad 2… People are still able to buy them, and for 100 dollars  
 less than an iPad..

In previous years, Apple had discontinued their previous product and everybody rushed to update to the latest and greatest.. This year,  
 Apple has decided to keep the iPad 2 alongside the new iPad and that has painted a picture that tells people they dont’t have to rush to upgrade..

Like I said, it’s an interesting trend…
