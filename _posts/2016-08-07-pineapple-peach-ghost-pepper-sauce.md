We grow our own Ghost peppers and various handy kitchen herbs in our back yard, it's nice to just walk out and grab what you need to make something.

A recent trip to the local farmer's market got me a few fresh peaches, and the pineapple, well, that I bought in a store since those don't grow on trees around here.

This sauce is a mixture of sweet and spicy, and you can switch out the Ghost peppers for any type of hot pepper you like, I also like to use Habanero peppers in this sauce.

This sauce is tasty on just about anything that can take the level of heat with the touch of sweet. It's a touch on the vinegary side, which works for me for many things. Try it over chicken, or a nice piece of fish, over a piece of sliced pork loin or pretty much anything. 

You can even just use some on your veggies if you want.

#### What you need

- 5 - 6 ghost peppers, coarsely chopped
- 2 cups chopped pineapple
- 1 cup chopped peaches
- 1 handful mint leaves, rinsed
- Juice from 1 lime
- 1 cup white vinegar
- Â½ teaspoon salt


#### How to make it

1. Add all of the ingredients to a food processor and process until smooth.
2. Add to a pot and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes.
3. Cool and strain, if you want a less-chunky hot sauce, if you want a chunkier hot sauce, skip the straining.
4. Pour into bottles and refrigerate until ready to use!
5. Makes about 12 ounces.
