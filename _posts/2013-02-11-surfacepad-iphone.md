The SurfacePad for iPhone is a smart cover for your iPhone.

> Made from luxury Napa leather at 1/10th an inch thick, the SurfacePad sports a built-in stand for hands-free iPhone use. The case itself gently wraps around the device, but does not interfere with the buttons, ports or camera on the iPhone.

I ordered this case as soon as it came on the market simply because it looked cool, and after a week or so with it, I can now give a good review..

And the result isâ€¦ I like this case :)

It folds over the screen nicely to protect it, and the adhesive back is quick to remove and put back on. You can also fit an olloclip on the corner to take quick enhanced photos.

The guys at Twelve South have made another great Apple accessory.

The fold of the case also works as a stand, so that is also handy for viewing videos.
