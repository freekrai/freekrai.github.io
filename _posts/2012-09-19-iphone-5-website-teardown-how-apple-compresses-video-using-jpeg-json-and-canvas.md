David Bloom:

> The [“Design” page](http://www.apple.com/iphone/design/#animation-unlock) for iPhone 5 includes an auto-playing video of the device being unlocked. But there’s no video element, just a canvas. And if you check the “Network” tab of the inspector, you won’t find any video there either.
