Interesting Mediation Techniques…

> The technique I’ll be teaching is breath meditation. It’s a good topic no matter what your religious  
>  background. As my teacher once said, the breath doesn’t belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone at  
>  all. It’s common property that anyone can meditate on.
> 
> At the same time, of all the meditation topics there are, it’s probably the most beneficial to the body,  
>  for when we’re dealing with the breath, we’re dealing not only with the air coming in and out of the lungs,  
>  but also with all the feelings of energy that course throughout the body with each breath.  
>  If you can learn to become sensitive to these feelings, and let them flow smoothly and unobstructed, you  
>  can help the body function more easily, and give the mind a handle for dealing with pain.
