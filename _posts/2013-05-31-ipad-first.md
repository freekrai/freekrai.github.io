Chris Bowler:

> On the subject of creating with an iPad, I’m a bit of a Johnny-come-lately. Yes, creating on the iPad has been possible since the day it launched. And yes, I’ve used it for a bit of writing. But I never embraced it like many others have. I was of the opinion that my more powerful and functional laptop was always the better option.

> Until recently.

I can relate to Chris’ thoughts on this subject…
