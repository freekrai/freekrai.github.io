Casey Johnston:

> Asustek CFO David Chang told the WSJ that the company was selling — not just shipping — 500,000 units a month initially, when the Nexus 7 launched in July. Figures bumped up to 600,000-700,000 in the following months, and in “this latest month,” Google and Asus have sold close to one million units, said Chang.

Sounds like a good start.
