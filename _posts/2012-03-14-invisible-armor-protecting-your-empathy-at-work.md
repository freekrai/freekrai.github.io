> Sitting in my cube one day at work with a deadline looming overhead, I was desperately trying to concentrate and couldn’t sit still.
> 
> I cleared my desk, adjusted my chair, cranked as much soothing music as I could find, but nothing was working. Did I drink too much coffee? Wait, I haven’t had caffeine in over five years…
> 
> Out of total desperation I got up, walked around the office, and parked myself in the first empty conference room I could find.  
>  As soon as I sat down and opened my laptop my head was clear. I got my wireframes done in record time.
> 
> This stark contrast – between the jackhammer at my desk and the 2001-Space-Odyssey-like womb in the conference room – truly amazed me.
