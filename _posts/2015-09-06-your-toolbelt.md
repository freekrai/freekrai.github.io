Every profession has a toolbelt, that set of tools they need to do their job and that has to be within reach at all times: writers have their pen and paper, chefs have their knives, carpenters have their actual tools.

And if you do DevOps, then your tools are usually on your computer, tablet, smart phone and sometimes your smart watch.

Our tools vary but all serve the purpose of keeping the servers running, keeping the developers happy, and even more importantly, keeping the clients happy.

Here's a list of tools I use in my day to day DevOps work:

* **Operating Systems**
  * Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian)
  * Unix (Solaris, AIX, HP/UX, etc.)
  * Windows
  * Mac OS X

* **Infrastructure as a Service**
  * Amazon Web Services  
  * Rackspace
  * Digital Ocean
  * Azure
  * Heroku

* **Virtualization Platforms**
  * VMware
  * KVM
  * VirtualBox
  * Vagrant
  * Kubernetes
  * Docker

* **Containerization Tools**
  * LXC
  * Docker

* **Configuration Management**
  * Ansible
  * Puppet
  * Chef

* **Test, Build and Deployment Systems**
  * Travis CI
  * Circle CI
  * Jenkins

* **Web Servers**
  * nginx
  * Apache

* **Databases**
  * MongoDB
  * MySQL
  * PostgresSQL
  * Cassandra
  * Redis

* **Monitoring, Alerting, and Trending**
  * New Relic
  * Nagios
  * Zabbix
  * Uptime Robot
  * PagerDuty
  * Push Over
  * Monit

* **Logging**
  * PaperTrail

This list will probably grow every other week, DevOps means staying on top of this growing stack of tools and using which ever tools help you get the job done more efficiently.
