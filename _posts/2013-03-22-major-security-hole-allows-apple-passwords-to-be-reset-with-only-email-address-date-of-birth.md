Chris Welch, for The Verge

> Apple yesterday [rolled out two-step verification](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4132500/apple-two-step-verification-icloud-accounts), a security measure that promises to further shield Apple ID and iCloud accounts from being hijacked. Unfortunately, today a new exploit has been discovered that affects all customers who *haven’t* yet enabled the new feature. It allows anyone with your email address and date of birth to reset your password — using Apple’s own tools. We’ve been made aware of a step-by-step tutorial (which remains available as of this writing) that explains in detail how to take advantage of the vulnerability. The exploit involves pasting in a modified URL while answering the DOB security question on Apple’s iForgot page. It’s a process just about anyone could manage, and *The Verge* has confirmed the glaring security hole firsthand. Out of security concerns, we will not be linking to the website in question.

> Needless to say, if you haven’t enabled two-step verification for your Apple account, we urge you to waste no time in doing so. Unfortunately for those outside of the US, UK, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, the new security measure isn’t even available to you yet. Those eligible can [start the process here](https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/). Apple has also set up [an FAQ page](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5570) for any questions you may have. We’ve reached out to the company and will keep you posted as we hear more.

Yikes!
