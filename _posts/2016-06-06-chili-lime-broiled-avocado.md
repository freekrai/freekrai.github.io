Avocadoes... the things you can make with them are incredible or just slice them and eat them as is. 

This is a fun recipe that is pretty basic, but tasty.

### What you need:

- 1 Avocado (pitted)
- 1 tsp Honey
- 1 Lime (juiced)
- 1/2 tsp Chili powder
- Sea salt (to taste)

### How to Make it:

1. Preheat oven to high heat. 
2. Drizzle the avocado halves with the honey and lime juice.
3. Lay on a baking sheet and broil for 5-6 minutes, until avocado flesh begins to blister. 
4. Remove from oven and sprinkle with chili powder and salt. Serve warm.
