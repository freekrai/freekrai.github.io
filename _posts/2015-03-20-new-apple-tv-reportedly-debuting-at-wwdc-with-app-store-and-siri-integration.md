John Paczkowski, writing for BuzzFeed:

> Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the subscription internet TV service Apple’s been trying to get off the ground since 2009 appears to be finally headed to market. And now sources familiar with the company’s plans tell BuzzFeed News that a successor to its dusty and recently discounted Apple TV set top box is headed to market as well. Apple intends to show the device off at its annual World Wide Developers Conference in June along with a long-awaited App Store and a software development kit to help developers populate it.
> 
> Sources say Apple’s new Apple TV is a significant overhaul of the device, one intended to undergird Apple’s vision of what the TV viewing experience should be, and to raise the table stakes in a set-top box market cluttered with barely differentiated devices from Amazon, Roku, and others.

The second the $69 price drop was announced, the first thought I had was that a new Apple TV was finally about to come out, and the price had been dropped to clear out existing inventory.

That said, keep in mind that this is currently a rumour, and the $69 Apple TV is a great deal.
