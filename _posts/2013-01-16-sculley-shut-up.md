> “Apple needs to adapt to a very different world,” Sculley said. “As we go from $500 smartphones to even as low, for some companies, as $100 for a smartphone, you’ve got to dramatically rethink the supply chain and how you can make these products and do it profitably.”

Seriously? John Sculley was the guy who kicked Steve Jobs out of Apple and nearly ran the company into the ground until they brought Jobs back, and now he’s giving advice to Tim Cook, a guy who has years of experience in supply chains?
