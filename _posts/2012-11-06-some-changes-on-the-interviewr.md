Over the past weeek, several changes have been made to [The Interviewr](http://theinterviewr.com):

- **Moved from Paypal to Stripe:** This was a move I wanted to do for a while, and once Stripe.com launched in Canada, I made the necessary changes. I still left the option to make deposits via paypal for now, but otherwise, everything has moved to Stripe.
- **Launched Transcription Service:** I’ve been eying making this move for a few months, and last month, brought a group of transcriptionists in-house to offer the service, so far, it’s been going good.
- **PIN Access:** Since people share accounts with other people (employees, co-workers), I introduced the ability to set a 5-digit master PIN. This lets users limit access to specific sections of the site without knowing the PIN number.
- **Movember Promotion:** To help promote men’s health, for the month of November, **80% of all deposits, subscriptions and transcriptions are being donated to the Movember.com foundation until November 30th**

<div>Yes, that last part was in bold, to help show how serious I am about Movember.</div><div></div><div>Some other changes coming this month include finishing up the new Mobile App, which is built for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, and is looking pretty nice so far.</div>
