[![The Perfect Cooker](/media/perfect-cooker.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2oyPi6Y)

I first came across [the Perfect Cooker](http://amzn.to/2oyPi6Y) for sale at my local Walmart, and decided to pick it up thinking that if nothing else it would be a good rice cooker.

And I was right, it is a good rice cooker, it's also great for pasta, and even makes a decent meatloaf.

The reviews vary but I've found that it really depends on the liquid, etc. Make sure you add the right amount of water or sauce and you can cook everything _perfectly_.

But where I've found the perfect cooker excels...With kids!

My daughter loves making mac and cheese in this cooker, and has also made lasagna in it, but has made mac and cheese more.

She reads the included recipe book, and adds all the ingredients, she's even started coming up with her own.

For example, the lasagna recipe is the standard one but she prefers _chicken alfredo lasagna_, so she's replaced the beef with sliced chicken breast and added alfredo sauce to get a nice dinner.

If you have kids that want to get into doing more in the kitchen, then pick up a perfect cooker.
