Over on TheInterviewr Blog, we’re running a little contest:

> We want to profile how our users use TheInterviewr, so to do that, we’ve decided to have a contest.
> 
> [Click here](http://rogerstringer.wufoo.com/forms/m7x3r3/) to tell us how you use our service, and how we make your life simpler in some way, and you could win one of 2 Google Nexus 7 tablets that were just announced this week.
> 
> All profiles submitted will get featured on our blog, and the winners will get announced August 30th.

I’ve never really done a contest before, so this is exciting to see what will happen.
