Federico Viticci:

> Since the release of [Command-C](http://danilo.to/command-c "Command-C ‣ Copy & Paste between iOS and Mac"), [I’ve been using Danilo Torrisi’s utility](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/command-c-a-local-clipboard-sharing-tool-for-os-x-and-ios-7/ "Command-C: A Local Clipboard Sharing Tool for OS X and iOS 7 - MacStories") to quickly beam text and URLs across all my devices, using [Launch Center Pro](http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/ "Contrast | Launch Center Pro") actions to speed up the process. [Command-C has excellent support for URL schemes](http://danilo.to/command-c/faq/how-to-use-x-callback-url "Command-C ‣ How to use x-callback-url") – a boon to iPad users who fiddle with automation tricks to save time when working on iOS.

> I recently realized, however, that most of the content I share with Command-C is made of URLs from Safari, therefore I asked myself whether I could put together a solution to send URLs with one click from Safari without using an external app or keyboard shortcut. It was pretty clear from the beginning that I would end up with a bookmarklet, but I have to thank Danilo for providing the necessary guidance I needed to achieve the kind of workflow I wanted.

I use Command-C nearly every day, so these actions can be pretty handy…
