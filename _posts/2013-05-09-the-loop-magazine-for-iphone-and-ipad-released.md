> On New Years Eve last year I said that I had [some big plans for The Loop in 2013](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/12/31/the-state-of-the-loop-and-some-changes/). The biggest of those plans is [The Loop magazine for iPhone and iPad](http://appstore.com/TheLoopMagazine), which is available from the App Store today.
> 
> I wrote an [introductory article on The Loop magazine Web site](http://www.loopinsight.com/magazine/issue-1/welcome-to-the-loop-magazine/) that you can read to find out why I decided to do a magazine, my inspiration and other details. I encourage you to read that.
> 
> There are clearly a lot of people I’d like to thank including Jamie and Daniel at [TypeEngine](http://typeengine.net/), a beautiful new service I’m using to build and deliver The Loop magazine.
> 
> I would also like to thank [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/) for his support and advice over the past couple of months. It meant a lot to me.
> 
> As a quick overview, The Loop magazine will be updated twice a month through Apple’s Newsstand and will cost $1.99 per month, with a free 7-day trial.
> 
> All of the articles published in The Loop magazine are exclusive to the publication and written by some great writers. For instance, the first issue includes articles from Matt Gemmell, Dream Theater’s Jordan Rudess, Michael Simmons, Holly Winewell, Peter Cohen and long time Apple analyst Ben Bajarin.
