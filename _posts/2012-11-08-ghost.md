Ghost is a blogging platform concept from John O’Nolan that focuses exclusively on blogging. It would Markdown for post formatting, include no native comments, require fewer plugins, and operate 100% as a not-for-profit. It’s a fantastic idea, and one that would be a welcome option for many who are starting to find WordPress too powerful for simple blogging.
