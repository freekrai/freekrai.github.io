The Kato Tactical Mini-Messenger For iPad from ThinkGeek is the ultimate iPad messenger bag.

This bag features a back pocket made perfectly for your iPad, and then a big pocket that can hold an 11 inch MacBook Air, and a bunch of other items.

I’ve carrying my keyboard in it’s Origami Workstation case for the past week in the big pocket, and it’s worked well.

The other pockets make this bag flexible while still keeping a small foot print.
