David Sparks:

> I’m pleased to announce the Presentations Field Guide on is now shipping. The initial response has been fantastic and the book is currently at the top of the charts in the iBooks Store.
> 
>  I spent a lot of time on the design and this book looks fantastic. Readers already are reporting they love the new design and layout. The content also came out great walking you through planning and giving a presentation in addition to all the parts you’ll be doing on your Mac and iPad.

As with the other Field Guides by David, this book is an excellent read. Congratulations!
