> I like the proposed <picture> markup except for the tag name. “Picture” is much more specific than “image”, and I bet a very large portion of images used on the web are not pictures. “Photo” would be worse, but “picture” still implies a complete photo, illustration, or diagram, whereas “image” encompasses those plus patterns, textures, gradients, and every other use of image data in use on the web today.

I have to agree with Marco on this, “Picture” really doesn’t describe this tag properly, simply because a lot of images on the web are not pictures necessarily.

Imagine if <music> had been used instead of <audio>? Yes, a lot of audio used on the web is music, but there are also podcasts, talks, etc.. Or if <movie> was used instead of <video>?

Keeping this in mind, I’d like to vote for <image> over <picture> as well…

It definitely fits better, and goes along the lines of <video> and <audio> better
