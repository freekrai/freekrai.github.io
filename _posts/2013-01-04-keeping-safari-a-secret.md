Don Melton — who started the Safari and WebKit projects at Apple:

> I wasn’t worried about talk either. Forstall certainly trusted me — that’s one of the many things that made him a great boss. And I trusted my team — otherwise I wouldn’t have hired them. None of us nor any of the internal beta testers at Apple were going to snitch. There were too damn few beta testers, but they were above reproach.
> 
> Twitter and Facebook didn’t exist then. Nobody at Apple was stupid enough to blog about work, so what was I worried about?
> 
> Server logs. They scared the hell out of me.
