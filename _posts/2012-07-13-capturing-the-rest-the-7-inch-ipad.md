David Sparks:

> I think a 7 inch iPad in the $250 price range, along with the app store and all the other great things that Apple has built, would be devastating to competing tablet manufacturers.
> 
> Apple employed a similar strategy in the iPod market and the rest of the MP3 player market never recovered.
> 
> I donâ€™t know whether Apple calls it the next generation iPod touch or the iPad Mini but the result would be the same either way, a lot of units sold to customers that would otherwise have gone to Amazon, Samsung, and others.
