Liz Gannes for AllThingsD:

> Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, has bought the small synchronization start-up Simperium, which makes a syncing platform for developers as well as a well-loved synced note-taking app for iOS called Simplenote.  
>  This isn’t one of those talent acquisitions where the products aren’t part of the equation; Automattic expects to continue and extend work on both Simperium and Simplenote.
> 
> “Simperium seems like a genuiune utility for our own apps and for other people as a service,” said Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg yesterday. “And Simplenote as a product I love and it’s just darn handy.”  
>  Mullenweg said he first wanted to invest in Simperium, then wanted to do a deal with them, then ultimately acquired the company to get access to the “brilliant” team and make sure their service was backed up by Automattic’s systems and infrastructure.
> 
> “I think they can help us completely revamp our mobile apps,” Mullenweg said. “Right now we download the entire blog post every time in our apps. Simperium only sends the diff [the difference between the two files]. It’s way more bandwidth efficient, and the online-offline opportunities will be huge.”

This should be a good opportunity for Automattic and I look forward to seeing what comes out of it.
