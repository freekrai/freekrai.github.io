Benjamin Edelman, writing at the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/06/uber-cant-be-fixed-its-time-for-regulators-to-shut-it-down):

> I suggest that the problem at Uber goes beyond a culture created by toxic leadership. The company’s cultural dysfunction, it seems to me, stems from the very nature of the company’s competitive advantage: Uber’s business model is predicated on lawbreaking. And having grown through intentional illegality, Uber can’t easily pivot toward following the rules.
