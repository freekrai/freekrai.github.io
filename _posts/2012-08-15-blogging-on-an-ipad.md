Charlie Sorrel on blogging on an iPad:

> “I do all my work these days on an iPad. From organizing reviews through gathering story ideas to actually writing posts and features, and even photographing and editing gadgets for those reviews, it’s all – every last bit – done on Apple’s tablet. I just spent two weeks away from home using the iPad’s 3G connection to work, only opening up my MacBook to sync my FitBit.
> 
> And they still say the iPad is just for consumption.

I do a lot of blogging on my iPad myself, so I like coming across articles along these lines
