> Nook Media, the Barnes & Noble subsidiary that includes the Nook line of ereaders and tablets, has [launched a new self-publishing platform for ebooks](http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/04_09_13_nook_press_release.html). Called “Nook Press,” the new platform takes the place of [PubIt](http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home), another digital publishing program Barnes & Noble launched two years ago, and uses new technology from FastPencil, a digital self-publishing company that [Barnes & Noble partnered with](http://thenextweb.comhttp://cdn.rogerstringer.com/media/2012/07/26/self-publishing-platform-fastpencil-inks-partnership-with-barnes-noble/) last year.
> 
>  Nook Press allows aspiring authors to write and edit their manuscripts on its website and sell the completed ebooks at any price between $0.99 and $199.99. Published ebooks appear for sale in the [Nook Book Store](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/NOOK-Book-eBook-store/379003094/) in the US and UK, through the Nook mobile apps, and on Barnes & Noble’s main website. Barnes & Noble takes a 35 percent cut of the list price of books between $2.99 and $9.99, and a 60 percent cut of all other book prices. That’s on par with the 30 percent cut and 65 percent cut Amazon takes from authors under [Kindle Direct Publishing](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/15/3089897/amazon-kindle-direct-publishing-costs-benefits)‘s options, and the 30 percent cut Apple takes from[ iBooks Author publications](http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/19/2720016/ibook-author-restricts-ibookstore-drm).
> 
> So far, Nook Press is only available to US authors who have applied for and received a stamp of approval from Barnes & Noble, and is restricted to the desktop website, but we’ve reached out to Barnes & Noble about more availability information and will update when we hear back. It’s unclear how the move will [impact Nook’s flagging device sales](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/28/4039542/nook-revenue-drops-as-barnes-noble-post-weak-q3-2013-earnings) as of late, but at the very least, it is on track with [what we previously heard ](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/1/4158458/e-bleeder-is-nook-on-its-deathbed)about the company’s plans to expand Nook Media’s self-publishing options.

This is actually the second self-publishing platform that Barnes & Noble has launched.. They first launched Pubit two and a half years ago. Nook Press replaces PubIt and expands it with web-based publishing tools.
