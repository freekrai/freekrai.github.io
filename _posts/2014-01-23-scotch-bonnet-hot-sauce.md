This is a hot sauce that is easy to adjust. The base peppers are scotch bonnet and jalapeño peppers, but you can also easily switch it up a little by leaving out the scotch bonnet peppers, or adding habaneros instead.

I’ve made this sauce for years, and it goes quick every time we make it, as it gets added to chilli, fries, or just about anything you’d want to add hot sauce too.

**What you need:**

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 18 fresh Scotch Bonnet peppers, sliced
- and seeded
- 6 fresh jalapeño peppers, sliced
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/2 cup minced onion
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups water
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

**How to Make it:**

1. In a large sauce pan over medium-high heat, combine oil, peppers, garlic, onion, and salt
2. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Pour in water, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the ingredients are soft.
4. Stir frequently.
5. Remove from heat, and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.
6. Transfer the mixture to a blender, and puree until smooth.
7. Pour in vinegar and sugar; blend until mixed.
8. Keep refrigerated .
