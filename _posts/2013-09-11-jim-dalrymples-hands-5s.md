Jim Dalrymple, regarding the new Touch ID feature on the iPhone 5s:

> Unlocking the iPhone 5S was very slick—just rest your finger on the Home button and the phone unlocks immediately. You don’t have to press or move your finger around waiting for it to be recognized—it just worked.

I’ve had devices with fingerprint scanners before.. and being able to just rest your finger on the scanner and have it unlock right away is the way it has to be.. When you think of how many times a day you’ll be unlocking your iPhone.. Think of how annoying it would quickly become if Touch ID added an extra few seconds to that process…
