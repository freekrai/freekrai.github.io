> Today AWS added a really cool feature called S3 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. With CORS, you can securely upload files directly into an S3 bucket, from the client-side, without using an intermediate proxy.

> This is awesome for companies that upload tons of data into S3, why not use Amazon’s servers rather than your own?
