> Googleâ€™s Android operating system has undergone a pretty incredible metamorphosis in the three short years since it debuted on the T-Mobile G1. Think about it: three years, eight major releases. Eight.
> 
> To put that in perspective, there have only been ten major consumer-grade releases of Windows (give or take, depending on how you count) in over twenty-five years of retail availability.

The Verge has updated their visual history of android to include Jelly Bean, interesting reading to see how far it has come.
