Nathan Ingraham:

> HP is preparing to launch its first entry into the Chromebook marketplace, if a PDF found on its site can be believed. According to this listing, HP’s currently-unannounced Pavilion Chromebook will feature a 1.1GHz Celeron processor, 2GB of RAM, a 16GB solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1366 x 768 display.
> 
> That display alone makes HP’s Chromebook a bit of an oddity — current models from Lenovo, Samsung, and Acer feature 11.6-inch screens, though they run at the same resolution as HP’s model. Besides that screen, there doesn’t appear to be much to differentiate HP’s model from the currently-available Chromebooks — it has the same processor as Acer’s model and the same RAM and storage as the Samsung.
> 
> Unfortunately, HP is only claiming a relatively short 4 hours and 15 minutes of battery life — far behind the nearly seven hours afforded by Samsung’s Chromebook.

As more manufacturers jump to Chromebook.. Microsoft is getting left behind..
