> Microsoft has unveiled a new Surface Pro 3 device at a press event in New York City today. Like the previous Surface tablets it still includes a kickstand, but Surface chief Panos Panay says it’s designed to remove the conflict of buying a laptop or a tablet.

> The kickstand on the device is multi-stage, and the device is just 9.1mm thick. “This is the tablet than can replace your laptop,” claims Panay. Microsoft has moved to a 12-inch screen on the Surface Pro 3 with a 3:2 aspect ratio and HD display, but the new tablet also has thin bezels with a silver and black design.

The Surface has also been a bit awkward at some angles.. Moving to a 12 inch screen won’t help there…

It is interesting that Microsoft made lots of comparisons to the MacBook Air during their announcement event. A decade ago, it was Apple that was comparing the Mac to the PC (in the long-running John Hodgman/Justin Long “Get a Mac” campaign) — now the tables are turned.

It’s also really interesting that they’ve designed the Surface more as a competitor to a Mac or PC laptop than as a competitor to the iPad.

In fact, today’s Surface event never saw either a new ARM-based Surface being announced or a [smaller Surface](http://www.zdnet.com/what-microsoft-didnt-announce-today-an-arm-based-surface-minid-7000029664/), as was rumoured.
