> AltWWDC is an alternative conference for Apple developers and designers, held alongside Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco, California. This free 5-day event takes place June 10-14, 2013 and includes talks, lunch, and co-working space, available first-come, first-serve every day. Confirmed speakers are Mike Lee, Victor Agreda, Jr., Brett Terpstra, Brent Simmons, Saul Mora, and Steve “Scotty” Scott.

This conference is just as interesting as WWDC, and it’s at the same time, just down the street from the other.. Definitely worth checking out.
