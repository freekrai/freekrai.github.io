Not your usual MacBook ad, but an interesting one nonetheless…

[Matthew Panzarino](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/some-brief-thoughts-about-apples-macbook-air-stickers-ad/), had an interesting take on the Stickers ad:

Bangs and dents mean these things get used. It emphasizes the reliability of the MacBook Air by showing that some of them have scuffs and scrapes. It’s rare in that it shows Apple products in a non-retail-box condition. The only recent personalization example I can find is iPhones in cases, which are shown in its ‘Powerful’ ads — but those don’t show any actual ‘damage’. The way Apple products look after customization and ‘real world’ use isn’t often represented in Apple ads. As Jeff Carlson points out, these are likely someone’s [real machines](http://jeffcarlson.com/2014/07/22/apples-stickers-macbook-air-commercial/).
