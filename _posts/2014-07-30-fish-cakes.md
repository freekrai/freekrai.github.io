I’m originally from Newfoundland, and fish cakes are a staple we grew up with alongside another traditional dish called [fish and brews](http://rogerstringer.com/2005/05/03/fish-and-brews/ "Fish and Brews").

You can actually make this with just about any type of fish, but I prefer to use Cod, or Sole, as white fish tends to take on the flavours you cook it with.

### What you need

- 1 ½ pounds salt dried cod
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 small chopped onion
- 6 cups mashed potato
- 1 beaten egg
- 2 tbsp dried savoury (optional)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder

### How to make it

1. Simmer the cod in boiling water for about 15 minutes.
2. Drain the water off the fish and allow the fish to cool to almost room temperature.
3. When the fish is cool, flake it apart with a fork into small pieces.
4. In a sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the onions and cook until they are softened.
6. Add the flaked fish along with the mashed potato, egg, pepper, paprika, garlic and savoury.
7. Mix together until well combined, then form into small cakes and roll in flour.
8. Fry the fish cakes in canola oil over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.

This is a traditional way to make it, you can also add a little hot sauce into the mixture for flavour if you wanted to.
