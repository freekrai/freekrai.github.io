> We thought we were going insane. This is just an AV adapter! Why are these things happening! Limited resolution. Lag. MPEG artifacts. Hang on, these are the same things we experience when we stream video from an iOS device to an Apple TV…

Apple’s [Lightning Digital AV Adapter](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter) apparently packs some serious heat to achieve its mediocre output.

As much as I may love the Lightning port as a device owner, this isn’t exactly the best endorsement for the practicality of its design for accessories.
