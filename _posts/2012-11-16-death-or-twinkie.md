From today’s Edition of The Next Draft:

> The company survived wars, bankruptcies, increasingly health-conscious consumers, and a new breed of parents who pay close attention to the carefully measured portions of all-natural, organic, gluten-free nibbles that they, with their loving and just-sanitized hands, carefully place into BPA-free lunch containers. In the end it was a labor dispute — on top of many other factors — that sucked the last vestige of life-clinging cream and “real” fruit filling from the company that brought us Twinkies, Ho Ho’s, and Wonder Bread. Following up on a week of dire warnings, Hostess [has announced plans to liquidate the company](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/hostess-brands-says-it-will-liquidate/). Analysts expect another company to pick up the assets and possibly restart production. [Twinkie the Kid may ride again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkie_the_Kid) (hopefully before those new marijuana legalization laws kick in).

> + Hostess made it’s last delivery of new products on Thursday night. That means we’ll be out of fresh Twinkies in 3,800 years. Actually, contrary to popular belief, Twinkies have an official shelf-life of only 25 days. Here, to prepare you do dominate any discussions on the matter, are [10 Twinkie Talking Points](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/151917).
