Craig Mod’s amazing essay on what’s next for the publishing industry:

> In product design, the simplest thought exercise is to make additions. It’s the easiest way to make an Old Thing feel like a New Thing. The more difficult exercise is to reconsider the product in the context of *now*. A now which may be very different from the *then* in which the product was originally conceived.

Another good quote from Craig in his post:

> Newsstand is perhaps the most underutilized, under-imagined distribution tool in the short history of tablet publishing. If you squint your eyes and tilt your head at just the right angle, you’ll notice something magical about Newsstand: given the proper container, it’s a background downloading, offline-friendly, cached RSS machine people can subscribe to. For money.

After this hit yesterday, a lot of sites have published about it, and it’s interesting because this is where I see publishing going as well..

I especially like this post from 37Signals last night titled “[Tablets are waiting for their Movable Type](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3334-tablets-are-waiting-for-their-movable-type)“:

> Remember the web before [Movable Type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type)? If you wanted a blog you had to program one. You had to know databases and webhosts and PHP or Perl. If you were “just” a web designer, or a writer with ideas, you had to hire an in-demand web programmer to make it happen. Publishing was expensive and hard.
> 
> Apps like Marco Arment’s [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/) give me flashbacks to that time. Wouldn’t it be awesome to publish my own magazine on the iOS Newsstand? People could read my articles on their iPad Mini, pay without typing in a credit card, and automatically receive new issues as they come.
> 
> Sounds great. But here’s the thing. To be on the Newsstand you have to program an iOS app. The tech hurdle is high, and hiring isn’t cheap. iOS programmers are in extremely high demand.
> 
> Now is a great time for another Movable Type. Writers would love a way to push serialized content straight to tablets, and the experience would be a boon to readers. Tablets are the best way to read, and Newsstand is the equivalent of RSS for non-geeks. Hopefully apps like The Magazine inspire somebody to make this happen.
