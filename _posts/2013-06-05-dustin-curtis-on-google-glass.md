Dustin Curtis’ impressions of Google Glass after spending some time using the device:

> While some of the human <=> computer interface design challenges facing ambient computers are obvious in theory, many of them are very hard to identify until you actually experience using the device as part of your life.
> 
> These computers are different. They don’t help you accomplish tasks with programs and apps, but rather they very literally augment the experience of living your life.
> 
> The technical problems facing these devices are tough ones– ambient computers need to be intelligent enough in software and advanced enough technologically to get out of the way.
> 
> Glass isn’t there yet. Not even close.
