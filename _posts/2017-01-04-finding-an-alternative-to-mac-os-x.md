I've looked at doing this a few times, I go between working with a MacBook, iPad, iPhone or a Chromebook Flip and work with Linux all day on servers, if I was moving away from MacOS, I'd probably just go with Linux Mint or similar Ubuntu based systems.

Wesley's favorite was [Elementary](https://elementary.io/), which, at a glance, does seem to be the open source OS that [most values good design](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines). And that OS does look good, so I may have to try it out sometime for myself.

Honestly though, I don't see moving away from MacOS as my primary operating system anytime soon. It's taken years for Apple to get this OS to where it is right now.
