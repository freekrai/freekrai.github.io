Fantastic new book from two of the smartest Mac guys out there. I’ve already added a bunch of bookmarks on my iPad of things I didn’t know about that I wanted to revist and learn more about.

Chances are reading this book will introduce you to new tricks you didn’t even know about before regardless how heavily you may use your Mac..
