Liz Gannes and John Paczkowski, reporting today for AllThingsD:

> What’s really happening is that Color’s engineering team — about 20 people, comprising almost the entire company — is being “acqhired” by Apple at what’s being called a “nominal” price of something like $2 million to $5 million, according to multiple sources familiar with both sides of the situation. To repeat, there are no “double-digit” millions involved, according to many people familiar with the deal.
> 
> Apple is not buying Color’s technology, intellectual property, domain names or liabilities.
