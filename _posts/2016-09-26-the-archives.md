Once a year, I move older posts that are no longer as relevant to the [Archive](http://archived.rogerstringer.com/).

These posts are generally, posts that are two years or older, and help the site keep fresh.

This blog has been around since 2003 in various forms, so it's managed to gather a lot of content over the years. Early on, I would actually delete some older posts but a year ago I decided to create the Archive and since then, that's where I've moved content that was two years old or older.

Today's archiving actually saw nearly 400 older posts get moved over, making the Archive now at over 2400 posts _(what can I say, I like to talk and write)_.

I definitely recommend considering having an archive to store old posts at rather than deleting them, as it helps you keep old files around, and can be handy to go back to.
