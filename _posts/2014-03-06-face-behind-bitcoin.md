Leah McGrath Goodman:

> Satoshi Nakamoto stands at the end of his sunbaked driveway looking timorous. And annoyed.
> 
> He’s wearing a rumpled T-shirt, old blue jeans and white gym socks, without shoes, like he has left the house in a hurry. His hair is unkempt, and he has the thousand-mile stare of someone who has gone weeks without sleep.
> 
> He stands not with defiance, but with the slackness of a person who has waged battle for a long time and now faces a grave loss.
> 
> Two police officers from the Temple City, Calif., sheriff’s department flank him, looking puzzled. “So, what is it you want to ask this man about?” one of them asks me. “He thinks if he talks to you he’s going to get into trouble.”
> 
> “I don’t think he’s in any trouble,” I say. “I would like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto.”
> 
> “What?” The police officer balks. “This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he’s living a pretty humble life.”
> 
> I’d come here to try to find out more about Nakamoto and his humble life. It seemed ludicrous that the man credited with inventing Bitcoin – the world’s most wildly successful digital currency, with transactions of nearly $500 million a day at its peak – would retreat to Los Angeles’s San Bernardino foothills, hole up in the family home and leave his estimated $400 million of Bitcoin riches untouched. It seemed similarly implausible that Nakamoto’s first response to my knocking at his door would be to call the cops. Now face to face, with two police officers as witnesses, Nakamoto’s responses to my questions about Bitcoin were careful but revealing.
> 
> Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.
> 
> “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,” he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. “It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”
> 
> Nakamoto refused to say any more, and the police made it clear our conversation was over.

Contrary to most speculation, “Satoshi Nakamoto” is not a pseudonym. That is his real name.
