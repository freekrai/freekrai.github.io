On the latest episode of Upgrade, Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talk about their first impressions of the new Apple TV. 

Their take is fairly negative — but both Jason and Myke clearly had worse first-run experiences. Jason had to jump through an absurd number of hoops to get App Store purchases working, and Myke couldn’t get the `just put your iPhone near your new Apple TV to transfer your Wi-Fi and Apple ID settings` thing to work.

For me, I had no problem getting the App Store to work and putting my `iPhone near the new Apple TV to transfer your Wi-Fi and Apple ID settings` worked great.

I've actually been enjoying the new Apple TV versus the previous one, I did have to get used to the remote control a little over the old one, and my wife actually prefers the old remote over the new one, but that just means we have dueling remotes half the time now.
