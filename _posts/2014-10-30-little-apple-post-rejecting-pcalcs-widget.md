> Arbitrary decisions like this harm Apple’s relationship with developers. If Apple wants developers to keep creating innovative Today View widgets, then it needs to publish detailed, specific guidelines of what widgets can and cannot do. When blood, sweat, tears, and livelihoods are on the line, “I’ll know it when I see it,” doesn’t cut it as an App Store approval policy.
