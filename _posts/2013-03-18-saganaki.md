It’s my daughter’s fifth birthday today, so I thought I’d share one of her absolutely favourite dishes.. Saganaki!

In Greek cousine, Saganaki actually refers to the type of dish the food is cooked and served in, and can actually refer to several dishes such as Shrimp Saganaki, Mussels Saganaki, Scallops Saganaki and the most famous Cheese Saganaki. This recipe is going to be about the cheese dish.

There are different types of cheese you can use for this dish. The two we find best are either: kefalograviera cheese or feta cheese.

You can also choose Graviera, Kefalotyri, Kasseri, or Halloumi cheeses. The cheese should be Greek and hold up well to heat.

**What you need**

- 1 slab of cheese, 4″ x 4″ and 1/2″ inch thick, trimmed of any rind
- 1 heaping Tbsp. of olive oil
- all-purpose flour for dredging
- 1/2 shot glass of Metaxa (brandy or Ouzo)
- wedge of lemon

**How to make it**

1. Pre-heat a heavy-bottomed skillet (a cast-iron pan works very well) to a medium-high heat.
2. Place your slab of cheese under running tap water then dredge in all-purpose flour.
3. Shake off any excess flour.
4. Add your olive oil to the skillet. Add a sprinkle of flour into the pan to test if the oil is hot enough. As soon as it sizzles, add your cheese to the skillet and sear for a couple of minutes.
5. Carefully flip the cheese with a spatula and allow to sear for a couple of minutes on the other side.
6. Turn off your heat source and carefully carry your cheese saganaki to your table and pour the brandy ( or Ouzo) over the cheese and ignite with a lighter.
7. Move your head back, shout “OPA” and squeeze the wedge of lemon over the cheese.
8. Serve immediately with crusty bread.
