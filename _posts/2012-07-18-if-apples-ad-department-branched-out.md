Applefied Ads is a blog that takes common products we see every day and creates advertisements for them that look just like Apple ads.

They’ve created ads for everything from Bic pens to Wheat Thins to Paper to Coke.

It’s an interesting take on how pervasive Apple’s advertising style has become, and the emotional reactions it evokes even when it doesn’t feature an Apple product.
