Forbes never fails to give you some interesting reading that should be just thrown away in the morning..

Today, they claim that Tim Cook should be replaced with Jony Ive as CEO.. Jony Ive is a designer, he’s not an administrator.

The writer even goes on to prove that what he’s writing is stupid with this comment:

> It’s unclear whether Ive has the skills to manage Apple, but the company’s competitive advantage has always been design

Forbes is one of those sites that I’ve been reading less and less over the years, and this is why..
