> I started teaching myself how to build and run URL actions with [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/ "Drafts - Agile Tortoise") in early 2013, when I decided to attempt to satisfy [Federico Viticci’s Challenge](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/chaining-multiple-apps-together-with-drafts/) to chain more iOS apps together than he had.

> I spent a few days feverishly searching for information on URL schemes, learning how to build actions and run them through the Drafts URL action engine, and figuring out the best way to create a chain which connected more than Federico’s record of three apps.

> When I triumphantly sat back and watched my iPad run an action sequence automatically chaining five apps together (Drafts, Dropbox, Due, Instapaper and Chrome), I had no idea that it would lead to [an article being written about me here](http://www.macstories.net/links/alex-guyot-chains-5-apps-with-drafts/), starting a blog to have a place to write about the actions I was building, an opportunity to beta test Drafts, and the chance to connect with all kinds of interesting, like-minded people from all over the world.

URL schemes are handy for chaining apps together, and this post shows you quite a few you may or may not have heard about before.
