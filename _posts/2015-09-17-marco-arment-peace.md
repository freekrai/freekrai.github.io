Marco Arment:

> Running the [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) browser add-on in my Mac browsers has been illuminating:
> 
> 1. I can’t believe how many trackers are on popular sites.
> 
> 2. I can’t believe how fast the web is without them.
> 
> But that wasn’t possible on mobile, where it’s most needed… until iOS 9.
>    
> Today, I’m launching my own iOS 9 content blocker, called Peace, to bring peace, quiet, privacy, and — as a nice side benefit — ludicrous speed to iOS web browsing.
> 
> There are a lot of content blockers being released today, but Peace strikes the best balance I’ve seen between effectiveness, compatibility, simplicity, and speed, powered by what I’ve found to be the best database in the business after months of testing. 

I've been using [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) for a few months now, and with [Peace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peace-block-ads-trackers-powered/id1031035630?at=1000l3yf), I can continue to use Ghostery on my iPhone and iPad since Peace actually uses Ghostery’s database of things to block.

**Update** Marco later decided to [pull Peace](http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good) from the app store, the main reason for doing so was the success Peace achieved which never sat right with him, so he decided to remove it instead. A move I applaud him for.
