Om Malik on launching Google Keep after just killing Google Reader:

> I spent about seven years of my online life on that service. I sent feedback, used it to annotate information and they killed it like a butcher slaughters a chicken. No conversation — dead. The service that drives more traffic than Google+ was sacrificed because it didn’t meet some vague corporate goals; users — many of them life long — be damned.

> Looking from that perspective, it is hard to trust Google to keep an app alive.

I have to agree 100% on this. How can Google expect anyone to trust them with an app when they could shut it down any time?

No thanks Google.
