Jim Dalrymple regarding a story in the L.A. Times predicting the Kindle Fire HD will outsell the iPad Mini by 2 to 1 — based on searches at CouponCodes4u.com:

> Tired of the bold, yet unsubstantiated claims of financial analysts, the L.A. Times turns to a bastion of data analysis for its latest story… CouponCodes4u.com.
> 
> > On Thursday, the folks behind CouponCodes4u.com made a bold prediction: They say the Kindle Fire HD will outsell the iPad mini by 2 to 1.
> > 
> > To back up that claim, the coupon clearing house website cited data collected from its website that shows nearly twice as many searches for the words “Kindle Fire HD” compared with “iPad mini” in the last three weeks.
> 
> Pathetic.
