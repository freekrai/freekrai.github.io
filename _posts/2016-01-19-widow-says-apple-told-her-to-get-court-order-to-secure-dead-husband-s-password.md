In times of death, a little sensitivity doesn’t come amiss.

Passwords are like locks. There’s no magic way to break into a safe after your spouse dies, unless they shared the combination with you. It’s the same with passwords, as it should be. I don’t mean to make light of the tragedy of this woman’s husband’s death, but there’s no way that she should simply be able to ask for a password reset. It’d be a huge security risk — a ripe target for social engineering exploits.
