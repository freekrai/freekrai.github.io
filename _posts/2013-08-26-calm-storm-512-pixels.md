Stephen Hackett:

> Short of Haswell-powered MacBook Airs and Logic Pro X, [Apple’s PR archive for 2013](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/) is basically quarterly results, shareholder payback information and WWDC announcements.
> 
> However, if my running list is correct, this is what we should see between now and December 31:
> 
> - New iPhone(s?)
> - New iPad
> - New iPad mini
> - iOS 7
> - New Mac Pro
> - OS X Mavericks
> 
> If we assume Intel’s Haswell chips are ready to go, Mavericks may usher in new iMacs, Mac minis and/or new MacBook Pro with Retina display models. I’d say it’s safe to assume the iPod line will also be tinkered with before the holidays.

It’s going to be an interesting couple months for Apple products….
