I actually noticed it was pretty smokey driving home today, and hadn’t heard of any bad wild fires happening right now (we had one two weeks ago though).

Reading the local news site, turns out we’re seeing smoke in the sky from wildfires all the way over in Siberia..

Interesting that smoke can move that far over the entire pacific ocean and inland like this..
