Jacqui Cheng writing for Ars Technica:

> Another year, another MacBook Air. Apple’s lightweight machine has come a long way since it was first released in 2008. At last week’s 2012 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple updated it once again alongside a plethora of MacBook Pro updates. Like the MacBook Pro, the newest MacBook Air received a bump to Intel’s latest Ivy Bridge CPUs and saw updates to its graphics capabilities, USB speeds, and more.

I’m a fan of the MacBook Air, I’ve had one ever since they came out and have upgraded every two years, in fact, this site was designed on a MacBook Air, and I do most of my work on one, so I liked the changes that came with the 2012 model. So this comparison is nice to see when you look at the differences over the last two years of MacBook Airs.
