I’ve been using this Compass since the iPad 1, I just realized today that I’ve never reviewed it, so here it is..

First, the fact that I’ve used this stand pretty heavily over the past 2 and a half years, should be a good testament to how durable and useful it is.

The Compass from Twelve South is a handy stand for your iPad (all models), it has two modes, The standing mode seen above and the typing mode:

Both modes work well in both portrait and landscape modes, so it’s basically for whichever you yourself prefer.

One nice thing about the compass, is that when you’re not using it, it folds up nicely and fits in a handy carrying pouch:

And I am really surprised that I haven’t yet lost the carrying pouch, but it’s still in my laptop bag with the Compass.

I like the angle of the Compass in standing mode better than the angle of the smart cover I have on my iPad usually, so that’s one big reason why it gets so much use. It’s handy when your using it to play a round of minecraft, for example, or do some reading or photo editing or drawing… Basically, it’s  
 handy all around.
