> How do I prevent this from happening in the future? How the hell did it happen? Turns out it’s Apple again – thinking they know better for how you want to use e-mail and calendars. Thankfully there is an option to prevent the forced invites.
> 
> These calendar invites aren’t coming from some magic hacked portal in your phone. The invites are coming as e-mails into your iCloud.com e-mail account and then being automatically converted into in-app push notifications to both iOS and macOS. Once that’s done the original e-mail is deleted. Gone. Poof. Magical, yet stabby.
> 
> Let’s turn off this magical conversion so we have the ability to spam the incoming e-mails and never have them hit your calendar.
> 
> First, open iCloud.com up in a web browser.
> Log into using the account you use on your phone (where your calendars are stored).
> Click on Calendar.
> Click on the settings gear in the lower left of the screen.
> Click on Preferences.
> Click the Advanced tab.
> Under Invitations set the option for Receive event notifications as to the second option, as an Email to rather than an in-app notification.

This post is just in time as I got hit with a bunch of these today too. After I made the change posted above, I got a few spam emails, but nothing added straight to my calendar.
