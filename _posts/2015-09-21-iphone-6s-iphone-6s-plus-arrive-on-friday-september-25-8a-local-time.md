From Apple’s [press release](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/09/21iPhone-6s-iPhone-6s-Plus-Arrive-on-Friday-September-25.html):

> Apple® today announced iPhone® 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the most advanced iPhones ever, will be available at 8:00 a.m. local time on Friday, September 25 at Apple’s retail stores.
>
> Stores will have the new iPhones available for walk-in customers who are encouraged to arrive early. 
> 
> Both models will also be available on Friday from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, additional carriers and select Apple Authorized Resellers. 
> 
> Apple also announced the fastest iOS adoption ever, with more than 50 percent of devices already using iOS 9.

It's amazing to me that iOS 9 adoption is already at more than 50%. 

And that was Friday's numbers,  remember, iOS 9 just launched last Wednesday.
