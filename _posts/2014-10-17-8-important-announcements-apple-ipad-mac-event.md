> Just about all of the announcements from Thursday’s Apple event leaked out in advance, and the event felt somewhat subdued compared to last month’s iPhone 6 announcement. A phone call with Stephen Colbert and a torrent of dad jokes livened the mood somewhat, but the bulk of the event focused on hardware. Just in time for the holidays, here come the iPad Air 2, the iPad Mini 3, and a gorgeous new iMac with a Retina display. On the software side of things, OS X Yosemite arrives today as a free update, and iOS 8.1 — which will enable Apple Pay on the iPhone 6 and 6+ — is coming Monday.
