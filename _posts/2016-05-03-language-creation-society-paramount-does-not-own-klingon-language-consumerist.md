> As we reported earlier this month, Paramount Pictures is trying to block a crowdfunded Star Trek fan film based, in part, on the [studio’s claim that it actually owns the copyright on the Klingon language](https://consumerist.com/2016/04/14/is-the-klingon-language-protected-by-copyright-paramount-thinks-so/). Now the Language Creation Society has chimed in on the case, making the argument that Paramount can’t claim ownership on a fictional language.
> 
> While Klingons have been part of the Star Trek universe since the original TV series, the actual Klingon language was not created until 1984 for Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, produced by Paramount.
> 
> “Given that Paramount Pictures commissioned the creation of some of the language, it is understandable that Paramount might feel some sense of ownership over the creation,” writes the LCS in a brief [PDF[Klingonamici](https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/klingonamici.pdf)] filed yesterday with the federal court hearing the case. But, feeling ownership and having ownership are not the same thing.”
> 
> While Paramount has long asserted its ownership over the Klingon language, and official books published by groups like the Klingon Language Institute, have licensed the language from the studio, this is believed to be the first time Paramount has made a claim to ownership in a legal proceeding.
> 
> In its brief, the LCS contends that Klingon is no longer used solely within the context of a fictional universe, noting that Microsoft’s Bing search engine, allows users to translate text to and from Klingon.
