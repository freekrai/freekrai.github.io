Marco Arment:

> Last night, within minutes of Apple approving the Instapaper 4.2.3 update, I was deluged by support email and Twitter messages from customers saying that it crashed immediately on launch, even with a clean install.
> 
> This didn’t make sense — obviously, Apple had reviewed it, and it worked for them. My submitted archive from Xcode worked perfectly. But every time I downloaded the update from the App Store, clean or not, it crashed instantly.
> 
> Lots of anxiety and research led me to the problem: a seemingly corrupt update being distributed by the App Store in some regions, including at least the U.S. and U.K., but seemingly not all — as far as I can tell, the corrupt file never hit Australia, at least.
> 
> And this is happening to other apps, not just Instapaper, updated in the last few days.

I have a couple client apps about to release updates so this is good to know… Wait a couple days before releasing.
