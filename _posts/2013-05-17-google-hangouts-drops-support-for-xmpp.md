> A company that was the cheerleader of the open web is rapidly turning its back on every single open standard they once championned. Their latest move, announced yesterday at Google I/O, appears to be[ closing XMPP server-to-server federation](http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess).
> 
> It is only a natural next step in a process started a while ago. Here is a quick, and probably not exhaustive recap:
> 
> - Google+ has no open RSS output, hence no PuSH support, no write API, in fact it has absolutely nothing open
> - Google Reader is scrapped, along with RSS support within Chrome
> - WebDav for Google Calendar is dropped in favor of their proprietary API
> - XMPP is dropped, while 3 years ago it was at the core of their Wave efforts
