Have you ever gone into an Apple Store? It doesn’t matter how busy it is, an associate is still happy to help you find what you are looking for and make sure you leave happy.

Have you ever gone into a Microsoft Store? It doesn’t matter how busy it isn’t, an associate is still happy to help you find what you are looking for and make sure you leave happy, and sometimes even throw in a gift they’ve just printed out with their makerbot 3d printer.

Have you ever gone into a Samsung Store? Good luck finding an associate, and when you do, the item you want which is clearly displayed on a shelf, needs to be ordered in as they don’t carry any actual stock.
