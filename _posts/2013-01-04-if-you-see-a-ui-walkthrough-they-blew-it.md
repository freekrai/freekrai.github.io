Max Rudberg on “minimal” app designs that rely on non-obvious gestures:

> These apps have chosen to reduce details to achieve a minimal UI, but in the process the UI has also become harder to use. Unfortunately a UI walkthrough is quite an inelegant way to explain the core functionality of an app. It can be a frustrating obstacle before you can dive into an app, and you have to remember all of those new ways of using it once you get in.

[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/04/ui-walkthroughs-blow-it) had a couple good points on this that I agree with completely:

> The most important design goal for most apps should be that they’re usable. And then, further down the list — maybe second, maybe tenth, depending — should be attractiveness or adherence to a particular aesthetic.

This isn’t just the case for iOs apps, but also for web apps. It’s nice to have minimal designs, but you should also make sure they are usable..
