I’m a fan of the [Logitech ultrathin keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/06/12/ultrathin-keyboard-cover) and a fan of the [Origami keyboard cover](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/03/31/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2-and-ipad), and I even like the [Logitech Tablet Keyboard](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/07/09/logitech-tablet-keyboard-for-ipad), so when I came across the new Keyboard case, I had visions of something similar to the Surface keyboard case and decided to try it out.

The result?

Not bad..

I prefer the keyboard on the ultrathing, as it is more solid, these feel a little rubbery, but in terms of convenience, you have a keyboard literally built into your smart cover that you can have when you need it.

One nice thing is that this keyboard will never have to be plugged in to charge or change batteries, it charges from light, so that is handy for on the go.

If you like the rubberized keys, then this case is the case for you, otherwise, I’d recommend trying out one of the others.
