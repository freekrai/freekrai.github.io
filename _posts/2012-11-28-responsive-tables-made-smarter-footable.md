There are many ways to serve each web element in responsive layouts.

For HTML tables, **[FooTable](http://themergency.com/footable/)** (a jQuery plugin) comes with a great approach without breaking the functionality and design.

The plugin auto-hides the selected columns on each breakpoint defined and users won’t need to scroll horizontally.

What makes it better is that **“**the hidden columns can be viewed by simply clicking each row**”** so that it is still possible to navigate through the complete data.

It is applied very easily with the help of data-attributes and the plugin leaves an open gate for future enhancements as there is a plugin framework within.
