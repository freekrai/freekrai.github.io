Shawn Blanc is searching for a new camera.

I’ve been down a similar road, we own a good Nikon DSLR that we bought after a lot of research and looking around, and we used to use all the time. We also own a Nikon point and shoot that works well too.

But over the last couple of years, they’ve gotten replaced more and more with my iPhone – mostly because it’s always with me and takes great pictures.

I’ve also been a heavy user of accessories such as the [OlloClip](http://www.olloclip.com/) or my [mCam](http://www.actionlifemedia.com/mcam-features), which really help.
