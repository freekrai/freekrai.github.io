Textastic is a great text editor for iPad and iPhone. I use it quite a bit for quick editing and it’s built in code support makes it pretty flexible.

It’s also now available for the Mac!

The app packs in support for 80 source code and markup languages, iCloud auto-save and OS X’s Versions. Built with [the ability to import syntax definitions, themes and templates from TextMate,](http://www.textasticapp.com/mac/manual/lessons/How_can_I_add_my_own_syntax_definitions__themes_and_templates.html) moving to this text editor should be pretty seamless for many users.
