> iOS 7 was [the biggest overhaul](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4407630/apple-announces-ios-7) for Apple’s iPhone operating system since its inception. Today the company introduces the next version, iOS 8. Follow along here as we update this article live with all the latest details from Apple’s keynote event at WWDC 2014.
> 
>  The overarching theme for this year is continuity between OS X and iOS devices. With [OS X 10.10 Yosemite](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5771840/apple-os-x-10-10-announcement-availability-features), Apple is enabling AirDrop file transfers between Macs and iOS devices, but that’s just the start of a series of new Handoff features that make transitioning between phone and desktop seamless. You can now handle SMS messages and phone calls directly on your computer, and if you see a phone number on a webpage, you just click it and use the Mac as your speakerphone.
> 
>  Tim Cook describes iOS 8 as “a huge release” that actually has two stories: one with a ton of new features for end users and the other rich on new capabilities for developers. Starting with the user side of things, you can now respond to incoming messages directly from the notification drop-down, you no longer need to exit the app you’re already in.
> 
>  Notifications can now be actioned directly on the lock screen as well. Craig Federighi showed accepting a calendar invite without having to unlock the phone. Moreover, third-party apps will be supported, with the demo including a Facebook tag that Craig liked with an affirmative tap of the notification, it’s seamless.

There’s a few interesting moves on iOS 8 that should be neat. We’ll see how iCloud Drive ends up working out though…
