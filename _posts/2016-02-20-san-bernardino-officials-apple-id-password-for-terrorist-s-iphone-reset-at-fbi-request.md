Huh? This story keeps getting weirder...

> The FBI has [claimed](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2716011/Apple-iPhone-Access-MOTION-to-COMPEL.pdf) that the password was changed by someone at the San Bernardino Health Department. Friday night, however, things took a further turn when the San Bernardino County’s official Twitter account [stated](https://twitter.com/CountyWire/status/700887823482630144):
>
> > “The County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBI’s request.”
> 
> County spokesman David Wert told BuzzFeed News on Saturday afternoon the tweet was an authentic statement, but he had nothing further to add.
> 
> The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday; an Apple spokesperson said the company had no additional comment beyond prior statements.

And as John Gruber [posted](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/20/san-bernardino-county-crawls-out-from-under-the-bus-the-fbi-threw-them):

> The additional wrinkle here  is that when the FBI first revealed this, [in this footnote](https://twitter.com/panzer/status/701087822522949636) (screenshot) of their legal motion (whole motion linked above, on “claimed”), they strongly implied that the San Bernardino Health Department did this on their own, like they were a bunch of yokels who panicked and did the wrong thing. 
> 
> Instead, it turns out, they were following the FBI’s instructions.

> The FBI says this happened “in the hours after the attack”. My question: How many hours?

So the FBI requested someone change the iCloud password, it got screwed up and so they turned around and asked Apple to build a back door into the account, which Apple has refused to do (good for Apple FYI).
