The Glif is a small and simple accessory for mounting my iPhone to my Joby GorillaPod. With the “serif” to hold the iPhone in place I can mount the iPhone any which way. The Glif also acts as a little kickstand to prop the iPhone up for watching movies, using FaceTime, etc. Though I nearly always simply have it attached to the Joby.

### So how have I found it after a couple days?

In a word, handy.. Very, very handy.. Hook this to your phone, attach it to your tripod and start taking some nice pics

### Any cons?

None, very nice design, works very well.

### Recommend to others?

Absolutely, I highly recommend this to anyone who is an avid iPhone photo nerd who wants a to attach their iPhones to a tripod.
