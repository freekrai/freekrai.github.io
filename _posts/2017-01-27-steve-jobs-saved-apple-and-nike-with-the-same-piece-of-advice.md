Quartz:

> When Nike named Mark Parker their CEO in 2006, one of the first things Parker did was call Apple CEO Steve Jobs for business advice. It might not have seemed it, but at the time Nike was struggling.
> 
> Yes, they had a successful brand. But they were failing to fit their digital strategy into their line of literally hundreds of thousands of products.
> 
> During their call, Steve Jobs gave one piece of advice that stuck with Parker.
> 
> > Nike makes some of the best products in the world. Products that you lust after. 
> > 
> > But you also make a lot of crap. Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.
> 
> 
> “He was absolutely right,” said Parker. “We had to edit.”
