The Daily What:

> A man in Spokane, Washington was surprised to find out that Comcast had changed his name from Ricardo Brown to “Asshole” Brown on his most recent bill.
> 
>  He and his wife Lisa had been trying to cancel their cable subscription with the company, which should have been a very simple process.
