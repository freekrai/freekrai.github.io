> The publishing industry has been revolutionized by technological advances that make it easier than ever for authors to self-publish their work. One of the best options for self-publishing today is Apple’s iBooks platform. This tutorial series will take you from zero-to-hero with iBooks by showing you how to create fixed-layout, flowing, and multi-touch e-books. Prior experience with web languages like CSS, JavaScript, and HTML is helpful when creating iBooks, but no prior knowledge is necessary to complete these tutorials.

I’m actually working on a few things with iBooks so it’s interesting to read ways to use iBook Author, and the tutsplus guys usually have pretty decent tutorials, so give it a read..
