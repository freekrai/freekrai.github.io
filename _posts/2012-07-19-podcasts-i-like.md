I tend to do a lot of driving between my house and my office, sometimes 2 – 2 1/2 hours in my car a day.. So I listen to a lot of stuff.

I thought I’d put together this list to show what I listen to usually:

1. [Build and Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/): this weekly podcast by Marco Arment (marco.org, instapaper.com) and Dan Benjamin (5by5.tv) is a nice development podcast that covers a wide variety of topics.
2. [Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/): another 5by5 podcast, they discuss weekly tech news, mostly around apple.
3. [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/) is on [5by5](http://5by5.tv/) and hosted by [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/) who I’m sure you all know. Jeffrey can get at the big questions with his breadth of experience in this industry.
4. [Core Intution](http://www.coreint.org/): a weekly podcast by Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece mostly focused on Apple developments.
5. [The B&B Podcast](http://5by5.tv/bb): Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks’ weekly tech podcast.
6. [ShopTalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/): Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert cover design in this weekly talk.
7. [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead/) with [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) is also on 5by5. It is an interview show but Jen brings a lot of her own web experience to the shows.
8. [The Non Breaking Space Show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/) with [Christopher Schmitt](http://christopherschmitt.com/), [Dave McFarland](http://sawmac.com/), and [Chris Enns](http://www.chrisenns.com/) brings in the “web’s best and brightest” for chats.
9. [The Talk Show](http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/) with [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.com) and a variety of guest hosts each week, covers a range of mostly Apple topics.

I listen to *most* of the episodes of the above podcasts. Kinda depends on how much time I spend in the car or doing stuff where I feel like podcasts instead of music. I also listen to others where I’ll download and listen a show or two here and there, like [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/twit), [Security Now](http://twit.tv/show/security-now/), or [MacCast](http://www.maccast.com/).
