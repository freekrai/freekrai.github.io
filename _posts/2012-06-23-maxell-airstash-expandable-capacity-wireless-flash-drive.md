The Maxell AirStash had a lot of promise, it used apps to serve as a wireless hard drive for your iPhone, iPad, android devices, etc.

So when I received one to review, I was excited.. Until I actually started using it…

Don’t get me wrong.. This device does have its uses, but also its drawbacks..

First, it acts as its own wifi access point, meaning you have to disconnect from your current wifi to use it, and while you are using it you are offline..

Actually.. That was my biggest problem with it.. The fact that I have to take my devices offline to use it..

Otherwise, it’s handy being able to replace the storage with an expandable SD cards, giving you more flexibility.

Overall, if you can handle the wifi issue, then I recommend this, otherwise, I don’t.
