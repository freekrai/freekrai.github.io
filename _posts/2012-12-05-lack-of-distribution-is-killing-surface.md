> If Microsoft is being coy about revealing Surface sales data, it may be for good reason. Early demand for the company’s first tablet is lousy. How lousy? Put it this way — if Microsoft really did[manufacture three million to five million Surface tablets](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/10/16/microsoft-plans-large-volume-production-of-surface/) to sell in the fourth quarter, it’s going to have between two million and four million left over at quarter’s end.

This really isn’t any surprise.. Keep a product limited only to one or two distribution methods and it’s not going to do well.. Put the Surface in stores, have it compete where enough people can see it…

And it *might* stand a chance…

Leave it locked away in the limited number of Microsoft stores there are, and on line where no one can demo it…

And it’s as good as dead…
