> Instagram released version 2.0 of its photo-sharing app just about a year ago, and “live filters” were touted a headlining feature — users were now able to apply a filter in the viewfinder before snapping a picture. However, for iPhone 5 owners, that feature is now missing. Yesterday’s update to the Instagram app brought compatibility with iOS 6 and full usage of the iPhone 5’s bigger screen, but it also removed the live filter view, though owners of older iPhones can still use the feature. Instagram’s support portal confirms the removal, saying that the current version of Instagram “does not support live filters on the iPhone 5,” and goes on to say “going forward, live filters will be phased out as we work to improve the Instagram experience for all users.”

Interesting move here..
