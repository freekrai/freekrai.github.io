> From Apple’s [App Store rules](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#push-notifications):
> 
> > 5.6 Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind
> 
> In practice, this rule is blatantly disregarded by thousands of apps that routinely violate it by sending promotional push notifications. It has become a widespread standard practice, even among small developers with lapses in judgment.
> 
> It’s not hard to figure out why this rule isn’t enforced — it’s mostly unenforceable. A violation isn’t likely to be caught by Apple’s reviewers in the few minutes they spend with each app.
> 
> Apple would need some sort of violation-reporting mechanism on each notification, which would add ugly clutter to the UI and would require a staff at Apple to go through each report and reliably act on abuses, neither of which Apple is ever likely to do.
> 
> And this afternoon, Apple itself violated this rule

Apps do this so much that it helps with the whole idea of limiting your apps that can send notifications.
