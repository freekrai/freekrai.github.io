Christa Mrgan, writing for Macworld:

> The use of Helvetica Ultralight as the system font is a mistake. I can say this more confidently than my other gripes, as I have my own 20/15 vision and the opinion of revered typography expert [Erik Spiekermann](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0syzCeH4Q&feature=youtu.be) to back me up on it. He calls the choice a “youthful folly,” saying that in large swaths at 13-point, the text looks like a lovely, smooth carpet — and is also completely unreadable. While iOS does let users adjust font sizes throughout the system, it may be a bad sign if many or most people choose to increase them by default.

Interesting read…
