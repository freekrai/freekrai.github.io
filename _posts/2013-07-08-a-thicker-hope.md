Marco Arment:

> iOS 7 beta 3 came out this morning with a surprisingly major change: as I first saw[reported by Sebastiaan de With](https://twitter.com/sdw/status/354294817875951617) and later more specificially [identified by Neven Mrgan](https://posts.app.net/7472872), the system font has allegedly been changed from Helvetica Neue Light to Helvetica Neue (regular).

Today’s beta 3 release of iOS 7 changes the system text font from Helvetica Neue Light to Regular. Light and Ultra Light are still used in the system in certainly places, but more sparingly and appropriately.
