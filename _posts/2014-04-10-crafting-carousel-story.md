Alice Lee:

> [Carousel](https://www.carousel.com/) is the new gallery from Dropbox that helps you organize, share, and save your photos and videos with friends and family (remember having to individually send every photo in a set over iMessage? Yeah, no more!). It’s an app that holds your photos and videos, and therefore your memories – and its story needs to do it justice.
