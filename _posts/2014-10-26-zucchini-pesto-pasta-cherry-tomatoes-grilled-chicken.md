I’ve been trying to eat healthier lately, and for that, I’ve been on a mostly paleo diet.

On paleo, there’s no pasta, so you look for alternatives, and this is one that was actually tasty:

### Ingredients

- 3 medium zucchinis
- 1 pot of fresh basil
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 package of cherry tomatoes
- 50 g pine nuts
- 2 dl olive oil
- 4 chicken fillets (500 g)
- 80 g (¼ cup) grated parmesan cheese

### Directions

1. Slice zucchinis into noodles using a mandolin, julienne peeler or even cut with a knife (gives a more uneven result).
2. Chop basil leaves and garlic cloves in a food processor coarsely. Add olive oil slowly while processing until blended. Add salt and pepper.
3. Heat some water. Add zucchini noodles and boil for 1-2 min maximum.
4. Fry the whole chicken fillets 1,5 min on each side until golden.
5. Place in the middle of the oven for 20 min.
6. Let cook until they are well done. Let rest a few minutes then cut the fillets up into 0,5-inch-cubes.
7. Halve the tomatoes and combine zucchini pasta, fresh pesto, tomato halves and chicken.
8. Toss together until everything is coated in creamy fragrant pesto.

You can vary this pretty easily, my daughter likes to have it with Alfredo sauce, for example.
