Garrett Murray:

> Recently, user [@rabble](https://twitter.com/rabble) put together a blog post titled [Origin of the @reply – Digging Through Twitter’s History](http://anarchogeek.com/2012/07/09/origin-of-the-reply-digging-through-twitters-history/), in which he did some research to show when it was first used. Only his research isn’t entirely correct and it doesn’t give fair credit to everyone involved.

Some interesting Twitter history from Garrett Murray. I like how many Twitter conventions sprang from users, not Twitter itself.
