M.G. Siegler:

> So. Apple did a curious thing yesterday. [They held a meeting with reporters](http://www.techmeme.com/170404/p5#a170404p5) to acknowledge a mistake. That mistake being the most recent iteration of the Mac Pro.
> 
> Well, it was as close as you’re going to get to Apple admitting they made a mistake. There’s still a lot of equivocation and defensiveness [in their statements](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/) on the matter. But the very fact that they called the meeting says all you need to know.

> This is an Apple mea culpa.

>  The only thing I can recall that was similar was around the “Antennagate” situation several years ago. Apple also summoned a small group of reporters to talk about that — [I was one of them at the time](https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/17/insider-apples-antenna-testing-facility/) — and also held it in a Apple building meant to showcase all the work they do behind the scenes on their devices. But that was a very different event. That was Apple defiantly showing off their advanced testing machinery to prove that _nothing could possibly be wrong_ with the iPhone. This was… a chat.
> 
> And it seems pretty clear why they did it. Apple was on the verge of rolling out some updates to the Mac Pro. But they’re so [ridiculously minor](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/04/apple-updates-mac-pro-and-more/) that the blogosphere would have thrown an absolute shit fit if Apple didn’t try to get ahead of the news cycle by previewing what is to come — something Apple _never_ does.
> 
> It’s: pay no attention to these Mac Pros. The real ones are coming! Also professional iMacs! And stand-alone retina displays! Oh my!
> 
> Of course, those “real ones” are coming… in 2018. Which is presumably why Apple bothered with the current Mac Pro spec bump at all. We’re a ways away.
> 
> And so Apple just released the Mac Pro, [Osbourne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect) edition.
