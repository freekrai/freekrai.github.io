Andrew Wallenstein, writing for Variety:

> The moment the media and technology industries have been expecting for years may finally be arriving: Apple is exploring getting into the original programming business.
> 
> Sources indicate the Cupertino, Calif., colossus has held preliminary conversations in recent weeks with executives in Hollywood to suss out their interest in spearheading efforts to produce entertainment content. The unit putting out the feelers reports into Eddy Cue, who is Appleâ€™s point man on all content-related matters, from its negotiations with programmers for Apple TV to its recent faceoff with Taylor Swift.

On one side of the coin, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and everyone else has original programming so who not Apple?

On the other side of the coin, Apple makes devices where Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Showtime provide content/apps. 

So here's the question: If Apple starts competing against Netflix and HBO in producing content, do they risk spoiling those partnerships?
