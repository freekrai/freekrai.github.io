NBC:

> A small Florida publishing company says the million-record database of Apple gadget identifiers released last week by the hacker group Anonymous was stolen from its servers two weeks ago. The admission, delivered by the company’s CEO exclusively to NBC News, contradicts Anonymous’ claim that the hacker group stole the data from an FBI agent’s laptop in March.

No surprise, and this is in line with popular thinking after it was released that it wasn’t from the FBI..
