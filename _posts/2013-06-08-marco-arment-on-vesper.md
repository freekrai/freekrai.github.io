Marco Arment:

There have been several reviews on this new note-taking iPhone app that was released yesterday by Brent Simmons, John Gruber, and Dave Wiskus (a.k.a. Q Branch). I’ve liked it so far, I downloaded it as soon as it came out yesterday, and have used it pretty heavily for my notes.

Marco’s review of the app pretty much covers what you need to know, and is worth a definite read. I also highly suggest you read [Federico Viticci’s review and his interview with Gruber](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/vesper-review-collect-your-thoughts/).
