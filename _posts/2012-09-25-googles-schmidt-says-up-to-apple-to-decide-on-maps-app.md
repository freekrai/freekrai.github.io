Lots of interpretations being tossed around on the quote from Schmidth regarding Google making their own Google Maps App…

I see it as two possible interpretations: as Google giving up on iOS, or Google dragging their feet and waiting to see what happens..

Here’s the quote from Bloomberg’s Teo Chian Wei:

> “We haven’t done anything yet with Google Maps,” Schmidt told reporters in Tokyo today. Apple would “have to approve it. It’s their choice,” Schmidt said, declining to say if the Mountain View, California-based company submitted an application to Apple for sale through its App Store.

I read this as Schmidt saying they don’t have a standalone app right now, and when they do it will be up to Apple to approve it — meaning he’s not sure if they will (they will). However many are sure to read this as Schmidt saying that Apple is holding the app, I highly doubt this is the case.
