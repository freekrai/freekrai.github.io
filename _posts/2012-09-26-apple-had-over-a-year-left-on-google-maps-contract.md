> Apple’s decision to ship its own mapping system in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 was made over a year before the company’s agreement to use Google Maps expired, according to two independent sources familiar with the matter. The decision, made sometime before Apple’s WWDC event in June, sent Google scrambling to develop an iOS Google Maps app — an app which both sources say is still incomplete and currently not scheduled to ship for several months.

Interesting move here.. I can understand some of the reasoning from Apple’s point of view, they usually push one big update a year, so divorce Google Maps now and then you have a year of getting it used so that people don’t miss it when the actual contract is up..
