David Pierce, Writing for The Verge:

> Go to the Roku home screen, select “Search,” and enter in whatever you want to watch (again, your phone keyboard comes in handy here). Up comes a list of where you can watch it, and how much (if anything) it costs. A search through my channels for 500 Days of Summer let me know I could rent it from Amazon, Vudu, or Blockbuster, for between $2.99 and $3.99. Searching for Jiro Dreams of Sushi brought up the same results, plus the option to stream for free on Netflix or Amazon Prime. The more channels you add, the more options you’ll get, and search is impressively well integrated across Roku’s most popular channels, from Vudu to Netflix to Crackle.

I’ve been a [Roku](http://rogerstringer.com/2012/05/01/roku-2-comes-to-canada/) [fan](http://rogerstringer.com/2013/01/08/on-media-streamers/) for a while, and the UI on the new Roku 3, just makes me more of a fan.
