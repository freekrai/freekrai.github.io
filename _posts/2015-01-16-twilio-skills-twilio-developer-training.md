Kyle Kelly-Yahner:

> Developer training for building or augmenting contact centers with Twilio is now available on [Twilio < Skills >](http://twilio.radicalskills.com/). Twilio < Skills > provides introductory developer training on Twilio products as well as deeper dives into Twilio use cases.
> 
>  The new Contact Center Innovator badge is the first use case deep-dive to be made available. It explores how to use Twilio to build contact center applications that provide greater context and relevance to customer interactions

I spent a good chunk of last year writing content for the Twilio < Skills > platform, it’s a platform I’m proud to have been involved in.
