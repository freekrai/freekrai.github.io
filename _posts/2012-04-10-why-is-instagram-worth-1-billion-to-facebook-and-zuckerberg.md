Andy Ihnatko:

> To my credit, when I learned that Facebook had paid a billion dollars for the photo-sharing social network Instagram it only took me about 45 minutes to stop obsessing over the thought “Man, did I ever choose the wrong line of work” and move on to the serious question of the day, viz:
> 
> “Why in God’s name is Instagram worth a billion dollars to Mark Zuckerberg?”
> 
> I gave it another 45 minutes’ worth of thought. Troublingly, my best theory was that Mark Zuckerberg stood to inherit a trillion dollars from his eccentric uncle, but only if he could spend a billion dollars in less than an hour without acquiring any tangible property.

It’s been an interesting development this week.
