Also announced today was the iPad 5, aka The iPad Air..

The larger iPad has gained a similar form factor as the iPad Mini, making it the thinnest full-size tablet to date.

This also is the first tine you’ve been able to get a different colour on the back of your full-size iPad, following along the same lines as the iPad Mini here as well.

The latest iPad is now weighing in at 1 pound, making it lighter than ever, and has also gained the A7 processor and the M7 motion coprocessor.

I’m still a fan of the form factor on the iPad 4, but this looks pretty interesting.
