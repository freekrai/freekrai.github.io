Today, Apple announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, a new thinner iMac, an updated Mac Mini, and some iPad news..

The new iMacs and Mac Mini are getting Fusion Drives, which are similar to Hybrid Drives, combining SSD with standard hard drive storage and work pretty fast.

First, the iPad 4th gen was announced with the A6x processor and lightning adapter to replace the iPad (3)..

And the least surprising news was the new iPad Miniâ€¦ Which is a 7.9-inch iPad, with a 1024 x 768 resolution, most of the same specs as the iPad 2, and an all-new 7.2mm-thick aluminum shell, which makes it 53 percent lighter and significantly thinner than the 4th-generation iPad

Surprisingly, Apple is still selling the iPad 2, alongside the Mini and the iPad..
