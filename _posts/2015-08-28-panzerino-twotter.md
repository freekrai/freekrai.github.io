Matthew Panzarino:

> Some very smart people I’ve been talking to suggest that, by building a platform, Apple is generating leverage that it can use to great effect in these negotiations. A mid-market breakout box offering is one thing, but a huge, rumbling platform with an upward trajectory of living-room dominating apps and third-party content is another beast. If, obviously if, Apple is successful with the Apple TV, it could be in a position to dominate content in a way that no other “smart” TV platform has before it.

> If Apple did indeed “delay” the Apple TV from being released at WWDC, then it probably had a reason. And, if my sources are correct, that reason could well be polish, polish, polish. The experience of using it is said to blow away the types of junky smart TV interfaces we’ve had to deal with so far. This is the first real Apple TV product.

Apple has scheduled their usual iPhone, new product announcement for September 9 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, a bigger venue than usual and possibly a hint that we will see more than the usual `S` iPhone model and updates to iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan before Apple officially releases the new operating systems sometime this Fall.

Panzarino, along with other, thinks we'll see a new Apple TV, and I think it's a safe bet that we'll see some sort of improvement or new model.
