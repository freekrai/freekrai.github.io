Russell Ivanovic, the developer of Pocket Casts, on his first time going to Google I/O:

> That said everyone I met at I/O was open-minded and tended to work on more than one platform. As such it wasn’t the least bit strange when someone pulled out their iPhone to check something on it. The majority of phones there seemed to be Androids, with the Nexus 5 making up the lions share of the devices I saw.
> 
>  What I’m getting at, and let me put it bluntly if I may, is that it highlighted just how insular and superior a lot of Apple developers act and feel. If you don’t believe me, just join a group of them at WWDC and whip out your Android phone.
> 
>  Within moments, you’ll wish you had whipped out something less offensive, like your genitalia instead.
