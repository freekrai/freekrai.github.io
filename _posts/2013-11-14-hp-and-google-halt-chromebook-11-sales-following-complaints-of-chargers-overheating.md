> The HP Chromebook 11 has been pulled from Best Buy store shelves, and sales halted on Amazon and HP and Google’s online stores, following customer complaints of chargers overheating. Sources at Best Buy first revealed to The Verge earlier today that urgent instructions had been sent to store managers to remove existing stock of the devices. “Stores should stop selling the HP Chromebook 11 effective immediately,” reads an internal memo to Best Buy managers. “Partner with Sales Support to pull the product off the sales floor to a secure location in the warehouse.”
> 
> On Wednesday afternoon, HP responded to the reports, confirming to The Verge that the company and Google initiated the halt in sales for the following reason: complaints from some Chromebook 11 owners that the chargers included with the notebooks were overheating. HP also advised current Chromebook 11 owners not to continue using their chargers, instead asking them to rely on third-party chargers. As an HP spokesperson told The Verge:
> 
> > Google and HP are pausing sales of the HP Chromebook 11 after receiving a small number of user reports that some chargers included with the device have been damaged due to over-heating during use. We are working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to identify the appropriate corrective action, and will provide additional information and instructions as soon as we can.
> 
> In the meantime, customers who have purchased an HP Chromebook 11 should not use the original charger provided with the product. In the interim they may continue using their HP Chromebook 11 with any other Underwriters Laboratories-listed micro-USB charger, for example one provided with a tablet or smartphone. We apologize for the inconvenience.
