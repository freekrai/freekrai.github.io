> It’s not too early to start thinking about getting your Mac prepared for Mountain Lion. By the way, I’m going on record as saying that Mountain Lion will be released to the public on July 18, 2012 — if history repeats itself, Apple will hold its third-quarter financial call on July 17th and announce the availability of Mountain Lion for the next day.

Nice article with tips to get your mac all spruced up in time for Mountain Lion next month.
