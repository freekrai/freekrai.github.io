> A month ago, YouTube unveiled its [TV streaming service](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15177462/youtube-tv-review-streaming-cable-subscription-service), YouTube TV. And if you signed up on launch day to take advantage of the month-long free trial on offer, heads up: that expires tomorrow, and you’ll be charged $35 for the next month. Do you want to pay for YouTube TV? Now’s the time to decide.

YouTube TV is interesting, not sure it's entirely worth the 35 a month though.
