> In a bombshell blog post today (via [OMG Ubuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/04/ubuntu-18-04-ship-gnome-desktop-not-unity)), Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical, the maker of Ubuntu, announced the company will [stop investing in its "Unity" user interface for Linux](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/) and instead move back to GNOME as a default for the next major version of Ubuntu. This also ends work on Ubuntu phones, which has been a major focus for the company in recent years.

> Canonical's Ubuntu is one of the many shining success stories of the grand Linux experiment. It's nearly ubiquitous in the server world, [it's available in Windows of all places](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11333522/microsoft-ubuntu-bash-windows-step-in-right-direction), and it's a very polished and user-friendly desktop operating system in its own right. But Canonical's attempts over the past few years to branch out into phones and tablets have been a near total failure.

About time.
