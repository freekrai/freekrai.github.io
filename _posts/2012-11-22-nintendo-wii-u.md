The Wii U marks Nintendo’s entry in the new generation of consoles, ahead of rivals Microsoft and Sony. The new system is powered by the [Wii U GamePad,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad) a controller with a 6.2-inch display in the center. You can also use your existing Wii Remotes with it as well.

The console itself looks like a beefier Wii, with full 1080p video output, 2 GB RAM and new, top-secret IBM PowerPC-based CPU.

The system has backward compatibility with the Wii, and Wii U games work with Wii peripherals, such as the Wii Remote Plus and the Nunchuk. Unlike the console before it, the Wii U is not backward compatible with Nintendo GameCube discs or peripherals.

The [Nintendo Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Land) game is also a lot of fun for the whole family, as is the [New Super Mario Bros. U](http://amzn.to/SgyiKJ) game.
