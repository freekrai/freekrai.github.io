With the Apple event tomorrow, you’re going to want to be logged into a live blog to see it, here are a couple you can follow:

1. [The Verge Live blog](http://live.theverge.com/apple-ipad-mini-live-blog/), this is usually the one I’m using, they keep you updated fairly quickly with posts and images as it happens.
2. [Engadget’s Live blog](http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/23/apple-ipad-mini-liveblog/), usually another good one to follow.
3. [CNET’s Live blog](http://live.cnet.com/Event/CNETs_Apple_event_live_blog_Tuesday_October_23), I like CNET, so this is also useful.

Which one to follow?

That’s up to you.. I’ll be watching The Verge most likely myself.
