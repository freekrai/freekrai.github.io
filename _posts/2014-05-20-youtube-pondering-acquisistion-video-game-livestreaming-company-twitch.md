Eric Johnson, writing for Recode:

> Twitch is a fast-growing service that lets people — mostly men — watch livestreams of other people — mostly men — playing videogames.
> 
> And it is booming: When Twitch started up in June 2011, it claimed five million users a month. In 2012, it was up to 20 million. By the end of last year, that number had jumped to 45 million. Broadband service provider Sandvine says Twitch now accounts for 1.35 percent of Internet traffic during peak hours in North America. That’s more than HBO Go’s 1.24 percent.

My 6-year-old daughter actually loves watching videos of people playing video games. My wife thought it was odd at first, until it was pointed out to her that it was no different than her watching her beloved Edmonton Oilers so many hundreds of times each year. The truth is that there’s nothing different about watching video of one type of game than another.

[Tricia Duryee, writing at GeekWire](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/microsofts-xbox-shot-potential-twitch-buyer-matters/), calls Twitch “the ESPN of the video game industry”, which I think captures the potential opportunity here perfectly.
