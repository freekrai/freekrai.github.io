I use IFTTT (If This, Then That) everyday, an automation algorithm that connects two or more internet-connected tools like a falling domino chain. Since its launch in 2011, IFTTT has expanded widely in the consumer market, with integrations on many popular gadgets from Fitbit, HP printers to Hue lightbulbs.

To help give users more creative control and ease of use, the company [today launched Do](http://blog.ifttt.com/post/111467477713/introducing-do-a-new-class-of-apps-by-ifttt), a new suite of apps that should help make recipe setups as simple as a touch of a button. 

The Do apps – [Do Button](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button), [Do Camera](https://ifttt.com/products/do/camera), [Do Note](https://ifttt.com/products/do/note) – are designed to simplify the process by letting users drag and drop tools they want to connect and customize recipes through a minimalistic UX.

### Here's a breakdown of the three apps:

1. [Do Button](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button) allows users to connect Web tools together and turn the function into a shortcut widget on their home screen. For example, you can set it so that every time you push the Do button, your current GPS location gets logged into a Google Drive spreadsheet.

2. [Do Camera](https://ifttt.com/products/do/camera) has a similar functionality, allowing users to daisy chain the photo being snapped to another application. For example, every photo you take from the Do Camera app can be programmed to automatically attach and emailed to a specific recipient, uploaded to Facebook or Tweeted out to your followers.

3. Finally, the [Do Note](https://ifttt.com/products/do/note) app lets users type any particular command and it can be added as a Google Calendar event or sent as a tweet. You can also use a voice command to trigger a recipe in Do Note.
