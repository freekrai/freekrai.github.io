Dermot Daly, on clients who thought letterboxed apps would be OK on the iPhone 5:

> I predict the iOS 7 effect will be worse. Within a week of running full time, those apps which haven’t been modernised to look like an iOS 7 app will look very old. They too will become insta-deletes.
> 
> If you have an app in the store, We’d highly recommend looking at modernising them pretty quick.
