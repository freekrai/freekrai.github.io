New, from Marco Arment, a magazine in the form of a subscription-based iOS app:

> Instead of the traditional labor-intensive magazine layout and expensive multimedia production, The Magazine’s article format is similar to Instapaper’s: one clean, adjustable, reader-friendly template with HTML, occasional images, and some small conveniences. It loads quickly, integrates well with sharing and system conventions (including text selection and VoiceOver), occupies minimal storage space, and shows the utmost respect for your time and attention.

I like the first issue, and I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes and wish Marco the best of luck with it..
