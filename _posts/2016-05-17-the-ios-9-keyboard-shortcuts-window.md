David Chartier:

> When using a hardware keyboard with iOS 9, you can hold the Command key to view a cheat sheet of an appâ€™s shortcuts (assuming its developer has updated to add some). But I noticed this morning that those shortcuts can be contextual, based on the task at hand or which panel or tab you are currently viewing.

The contextual menu is interesting, and handy.
