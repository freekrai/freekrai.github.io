Mac Observer:

> Apple just raised the cap on Apple TV app sizes from 200 MB up to 4 GB, bringing them in line with iPhone and iPad apps. Apple told developers the change lets them give users a better overall experience. 
> 
> For end users, that means more immersive apps and potentially a step towards a 4K Apple TV.
