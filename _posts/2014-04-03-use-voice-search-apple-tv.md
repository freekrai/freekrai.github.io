When Amazon introduced the Fire TV yesterday, much was made about the ability to do voice search on the device.

Kirk McElhearn walks through the process of doing the same thing on Apple TV, using the iOS Remote app.

> You can already do this with the Apple TV; not with its own remote, but with the iOS Remote app. Open the Remote app, tap on your Apple TV, and you will be able to control it. If you go to a search field, you can dictate into your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, instead of typing.
> 
> Say you tap the Search button in one of the iTunes Store apps: movies, TV shows, music. The Remote app displays a search field, with a keyboard below it; tap the microphone button and speak into your device’s microphone.
> 
> You’ll see the waves dancing around at the bottom of the screen as you talk. When you’re finished, tap Done, then tap return. The Remote app will send your text to the Apple TV.
> 
> Granted, you need an iOS device to do this, but if you have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, there’s no reason not to take advantage of voice search right now on your Apple TV.
