Apple senior vice president (and noted karaoke enthusiast) Eddy Cue, [was interviewed by USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/05/apple-music-hooks-11-million-trial-members-app-store-has-record-july/31197721/):

> One month after unveiling its new streaming music service, Apple has locked in 11 million trial members, company executives tell USA TODAY.
>
> “We’re thrilled with the numbers so far,” says Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, adding that of that sum 2 million have opted for the more lucrative family plan at $14.99 a month for up to six people.

People were estimating there were around 10 million Apple music users, so looks like they were in the right neighborhood. 

Of course, 11 million users who aren’t actually handing over any money doesn’t really mean much at this point, now Apple has to retain those users after the remaining two months of the free trial are up. How to do that?
