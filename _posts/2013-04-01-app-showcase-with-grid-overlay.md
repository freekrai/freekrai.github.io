> Today we will be creating a little app showcase with a neat effect. The idea is to show a mobile device with a screenshot of an app and when clicking on the device, a grid appears, showing some more screenshots. The effect is very subtle: the device moves back and the grid fades in and scales up. When clicking on another screenshot, the device image gets updated and the grid disappears again.
