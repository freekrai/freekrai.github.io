> CES is as much about the future as it about the junk that gets left behind. Here in the cavernous halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and the suites of the city's most opulent hotels and casinos, we see a lot of gadgets that spring up out of nowhere as fast as they fade into obscurity.

> As part of a promotional campaign for his American Greetings brand of greeting cards, Parks and Recreations star Nick Offerman came to Vegas to opine about the pitfalls of modern technology.
