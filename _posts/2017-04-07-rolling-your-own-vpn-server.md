Dan Moren:

> With the news that [internet service providers may soon start scanning all your personal data and using it to target ads](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/28/the-house-just-voted-to-wipe-out-the-fccs-landmark-internet-privacy-protections/), I decided it was time to investigate setting up a virtual private network (VPN) server. I’ve mentioned this in a couple places, including recently on Clockwise, and had more than a few people asking if I’d document my experience.

Dan walks through how to set up OpenVPN on your own machine, which works great.

I use [ExpressVPN](http://www.expressrefer.com/refer-a-friend/30-days-free/?referrer_id=9547199&utm_campaign=referrals&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=referral_dashboard) myself currently as my primary VPN which is nice if you don't want to roll your own VPN server.
