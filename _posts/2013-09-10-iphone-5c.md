> The new iPhone 5C is finally official. After months of [rumor and speculation](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/12/4614200/apple-iphone-5s-rumors-what-to-expect), Apple has opted to introduce its latest smartphone today at a special event in Cupertino. CEO Tim Cook detailed the latest updates in iOS7, noting that Apple has been “hard at work completing iOS7″ in time for its [September 18th release](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715240/ios-7-release-date), before inviting Phll Shiller on stage to unveiled the new iPhone 5C. It looks identical to the [leaks](http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/6/4498260/low-cost-iphone-allegedly-captured-in-photos-and-video/in/4476019) and case parts we’ve seen recently, with a plastic back and a variety of colors.

> The back and sides of the device are made from a single part, with options for green, white, blue, red, and yellow colors. Shiller claims you “won’t see seams, or part lines, or joins,” and the device is made from hard-coated polycarbonate. Apple has also created custom cases with a soft-feel silicon rubber that enclose the handset. The cases, priced at $29 each, also provide an additional color option on top of the regular colors of the iPhone 5C.
