> Castro 1.0.4 had received 10 App Store reviews in the first three days of its release. After three days 1.0.5 had 48.
> 
> We wondered if the dramatic increase was a coincidence so when 1.0.6 was released we left the request out. Three days later we had only 4 new reviews, after a week we had 8. It took three weeks to get 24 reviews, half of what we had after three days for the previous version.

The developers behind Castro shared some numbers after figuring out a way to ask for App Store reviews.
