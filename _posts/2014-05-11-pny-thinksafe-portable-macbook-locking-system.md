Some days I work from home, some days I work from coffee shops, and some days I work from a local [coworking place](http://coworkpenticton.com). And some days, I work from a hotel as I travel for a conference or other business event.

There are times when it would be nice to have a laptop lock, but Apple removed the standard logging port from MacBook Airs and Pros a few years back.

PNY has addressed this issue with a new locking system which involves sliding a very thing metal dongle which slides under the screen. You can then lock this to the included cable.

It’s not perfect, I wouldn’t leave the dongle in place all the time, since when it’s in there, the cover doesn’t sit flush, but it works, and it’s easy to add and remove.

If you ever take your MacBook anywhere where you’d feel a little better being able to leave it locked to a table while you line back up for another shot of caffeine.. This is the solution for you.
