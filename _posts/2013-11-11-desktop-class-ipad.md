I agree with this post, and Iâ€™d also like to throw in that the two dynamics of the iPad Air, speed and size, go hand in hand to increasing both usability and delight of use. The lighter form factor makes the iPad easier to use more frequently, and the better processor makes the iPad more enjoyable to use when you are using it.
