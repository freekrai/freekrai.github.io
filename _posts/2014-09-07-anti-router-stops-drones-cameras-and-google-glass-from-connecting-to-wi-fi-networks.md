> Are you paranoid that strangers are using drones, security cameras, hidden microphones, or even Google Glass to spy on you?
> 
> If so, you might be interested in a little device called [Cyborg Unplug](http://plugunplug.net/). Just stick it into a power outlet and watch as it sounds an alarm whenever such a surveillance device enters the vicinity of your home.
> 
> Even better, you can lock those devices from connecting to your Wi-Fi network. If you’re really looking to make a statement, you can even show those “[Glassholes](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5955973/we-are-all-glassholes-now)” who’s boss by preventing all surveillance devices near your Cyborg Unplug from connecting to any Wi-Fi network.
