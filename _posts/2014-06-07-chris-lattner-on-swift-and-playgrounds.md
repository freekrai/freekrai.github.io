Chris Lattner:

> I started work on the [Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_programming_language)) in July of 2010. I implemented much of the basic language structure, with only a few people knowing of its existence. A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013.
> 
> The Swift language is the product of tireless effort from a team of language experts, documentation gurus, compiler optimization ninjas, and an incredibly important internal dogfooding group who provided feedback to help refine and battle-test ideas. Of course, it also greatly benefited from the experiences hard-won by many other languages in the field, drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.
> 
> The Xcode Playgrounds feature and REPL were a personal passion of mine, to make programming more interactive and approachable. The Xcode and LLDB teams have done a phenomenal job turning crazy ideas into something truly great. Playgrounds were heavily influenced by [Bret Victor’s ideas](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming), by [Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/lighttable/) and by many other interactive systems. I hope that by making programming more approachable and fun, we’ll appeal to the next generation of programmers and to help redefine how Computer Science is taught.

I’m still amazed that Apple managed to keep Swift secret until its unveiling during Monday’s keynote.
