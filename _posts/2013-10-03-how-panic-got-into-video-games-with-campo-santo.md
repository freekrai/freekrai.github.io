Dave Tach, writing for Polygon:

> So when ex-Telltale Games designer and writer Sean Vanaman announced last month that the first game from Campo Santo, his new video game development studio, was “being both backed by and made in collaboration with the stupendous, stupidly-successful Mac utility software-cum-design studio slash app/t-shirt/engineering company Panic Inc. from Portland, Oregon,” it wasn’t expected, but it wasn’t exactly surprising, either. It was, instead, the logical conclusion of years-long friendships and suddenly aligning desires.

I’m a fan of just about everything that comes out of Panic, so I can’t wait to see what comes of this.
