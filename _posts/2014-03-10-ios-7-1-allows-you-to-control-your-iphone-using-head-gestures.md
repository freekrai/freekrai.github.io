> This is so very cool. First, you’ll need to upgrade to iOS 7.1.
> 
> Once that’s done, open Settings and go to:
> 
> General > Accessibility > Switch Control
> 
> Tap Switches to add a new switch. Use a source of Camera, then Left Head Movement and a System setting of Siri. In other words, I want the camera to watch me and when I shake my head to the left, I want the system to bring up Siri.
> 
> Now tap back and tap Switch Control to On.
> 
> You should see some blue rectangles scanning each item on the screen. Shake your head to the left. Siri should come up.
