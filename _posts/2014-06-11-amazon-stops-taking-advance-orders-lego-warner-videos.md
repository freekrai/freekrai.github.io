David Streitfeld, writing for the NYT:

> The Everything Store is shrinking again. Amazon customers who want to order forthcoming Warner Home Video features, including *The Lego Movie*, *300: Rise of an Empire*, *Winter’s Tale* and *Transcendence*, are finding it impossible to do so.
> 
> The retailer’s refusal to sell the movies is part of its effort to gain leverage in yet another major confrontation with a supplier to become public in recent weeks.

Amazon playing hardball with Warner Videos… I see this on being a little risky.. Won’t it just drive a lot of people to go pre-order these movies somewhere else instead?
