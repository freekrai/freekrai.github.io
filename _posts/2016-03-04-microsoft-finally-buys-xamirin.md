> I have exciting news for developers everywhere: I am proud to announce that Microsoft has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Xamarin. We are thrilled to join the team at Microsoft when the transaction closes.
> 
> We founded Xamarin more than 4 years ago with the mission to make native mobile development fast, easy, and fun and to help C# developers build beautiful mobile apps and reach billions of devices. We love the native iOS, Android, and Mac APIs and we love C#, and this acquisition is an ideal next step for us and for our customers.
>
> Since we started Xamarin in 2011, the company has grown to more than 350 people around the world, thousands of customers, and tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue. We have created amazing products to help developers build, test, and monitor their apps. Our company has thrived and I am so proud of what this team has accomplished.
> 
> To all Xamarins, thank you for the hard work and dedication that got us to this point. To our customers, thank you for your trust and faith in us. We wouldn’t be here today without you and we’ll continue to serve you at every step in your mobile journey.
> 
> This acquisition is a new beginning for Xamarin—the company and its products—and is an opportunity to help many, many more developers build great apps. Like many of you, I see Microsoft and Xamarin as a perfect fit. Microsoft’s mobile-first, cloud-first strategy is a great match for the Xamarin products and team. Check out Scott Guthrie’s blog post to get his perspective.

This is a move that surprised no one, other than to ask why it took so long to finally happen.

For those who don't know, Xamirin is an IDE that let's you write native iOS, Android, and desktop apps.
