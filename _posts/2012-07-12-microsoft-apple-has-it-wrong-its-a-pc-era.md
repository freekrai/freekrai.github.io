This is interesting coming from Microsoft..

Kevin Turner is trying to say that people want devices that you can use the same as PCs as well as extras..

At the same time, they’re making a version of Windows 8 that is tablet only (Windows RT), and a PC version of Windows 8.

In fact, if you remember a couple weeks ago, they’re also making two types of tablets, both with the same name..

I think Microsoft just wants to cause confusion everywhere so no one forgets about them.
