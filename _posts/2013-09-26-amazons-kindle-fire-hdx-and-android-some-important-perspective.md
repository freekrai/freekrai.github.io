J.R. Raphael:

> Here’s what it boils down to, gang: The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX products are Amazon media devices — not Android tablets. You lose much of the power and versatility of Android but gain the simplicity of Amazon’s own Amazon-centric vision. It’s a completely different ecosystem and environment — which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, so long as that’s what you want.

Raphael has some interesting points here.. And it’s been pretty obvious ever since the first Kindle tablet that Amazon had no interest in the greater Android ecosystem.

Android is just an implementation detail, from Amazon’s perspective. Amazon’s press release for the new tablets doesn’t mention “Android” even once, it talks about “Fire OS” instead…
