Science fiction movies, by their very nature, tend to feature a very high amount of badass visuals, making them perfect fodder for an epic supercut.

And that is just what YouTube has been graced with this month, in the shape of this six-minute video that spans more than 100 of the best-known sci-fi flicks to date.

Featuring everything from Jurassic Park, E.T. and Back to the Future to the somewhat less accomplished Aeon Flux and The Hunger Games film adaptations.
