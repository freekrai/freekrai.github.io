Marco Arment on how Apple just re-ignited the App gold rush:

> Apple has set fire to iOS. Everythingâ€™s in flux. Those with the least to lose have the most to gain, because this fall, hundreds of millions of people will start demanding apps for a platform with thousands of old, stale players and not many new, nimble alternatives.

I have to agree with Marco on this, with the OS refresh that is iOS 7.. We are going to see app developers jumping to relaunch their apps to fit the new UI style, and that will re-ignite the industry once more as people want to try to coolest looking apps again
