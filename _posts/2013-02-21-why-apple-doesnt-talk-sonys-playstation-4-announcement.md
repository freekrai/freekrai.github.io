Matt Drance:

> An increasingly-justified fear of irrelevance seems to be driving Sony’s every move these days. Its latest public display: yesterday’s clearly-too-soon announcement of the PlayStation 4. It was by nearly all accounts a bizarre [two-hour ordeal](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/02/21/sonys-ps-4-event-no-price-release-date-detailed-specs-or-image-of-the-damn-thing/?fromcat=all) that featured no launch date, no pricing, *and no product.*
> 
> Everything about this event, from the lack of specifics, to the [Office Space slides with MS Paint brains](http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-20-at-3.16.40-PM.jpg), to the [creepy old man head](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2206497/face.jpg), points to a rushed announcement. Why? Why did Sony need to talk on February 20th? Why not wait for a presentable product? Some playable games? Anything *real*? And why release the technical specs [after the event](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4011496/playstation-4-tech-specs-revealed-amd-jaguar-cpu-faster-blu-ray-720p), having just filled a room with reporters for two hours? Even the [official press release](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-introduces-wireless-controller-for-playstation4-dualshock4-and-playstation4-eye-192162531.html) feels sloppy, listing PlayStation 4 itself after the new controller and camera. Everything about the announcement is weird.
