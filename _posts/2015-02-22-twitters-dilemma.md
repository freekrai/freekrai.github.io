Interesting piece by Matthew Panzarino on where Twitter is now and where it’s going:

> At times (quite a bit) the way that Twitter has chosen to roll out features and products has felt schizophrenic. And that’s no wonder, really, as the company now serves two masters. Its users and its shareholders. And while those interests may sometimes align, there is no question which is the more important to please for a public company. This has led to rocky times when it comes to external, and even internal, perceptions of Twitter’s directional confidence.
