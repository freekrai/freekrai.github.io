Best known for its hugely popular microblogging platform, Tumblr is today venturing a bit further into photo sharing. The company has announced the launch of Photoset, a free iOS app that allows iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad users to quickly piece together photo collections and share them with friends and family. No Tumblr account is required, though your creations can easily be posted to any blog you maintain on the service.

> It’s hard to imagine Tumblr without photos, and we love the power a set of photos has to tell a story

Using Photoset is relatively straightforward. You can choose to import photos from your camera roll or take a picture on the spot, after which you’ll be able to drag and reposition your collection in various layout schemes. If you’re not on Tumblr, the app generates a photoset.com URL that can be shared via email or on Twitter. Photoset is available now in the App Store as a universal download for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
