> Twitter has apparently shut off pieces of its API access to Instagram, blocking Instagrammers from the Twitter section of “Find Friends” inside of the app. As TechCrunch notes, it’s a worrisome situation given that Twitter’s Jack Dorsey is an Instagram investor, and Benchmark Capital has both of the companies in its portfolio.

Facebook and Twitter simply don’t play well together, as has been noted numerous times before. If Facebook continues its push toward consumer-friendly products (TV shows anyone?) it only makes sense to start culling the companies that could infringe upon its own versions.

Is Twitter starting to deliver its consistent experience?
