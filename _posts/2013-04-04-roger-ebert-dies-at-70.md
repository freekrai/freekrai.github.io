Roger Ebert’s writing was always fun to read, and he had a quality to it that inspired his readers to want to be better writers themselves.

I actually remember watching his movie reviews many nights growing up.. Ironically, we’d have to sit through episodes of MT3K before his show came up right after it..

And trust me.. Nothing makes you appreciate a review more than sitting through an episode of MT3K..
