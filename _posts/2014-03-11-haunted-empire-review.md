Charles Arthur reviews *Yukari Iwatani Kane’s Haunted Empire*:

> *Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs* is a terrific book title.
> 
> Pity the book doesn’t live up to it. Or, indeed, provide us with any clear indication of whether the company best known for its iPhones and iPads (let’s call it an “empire” for convenience) is indeed haunted.

Great review for a not-so-great book…
