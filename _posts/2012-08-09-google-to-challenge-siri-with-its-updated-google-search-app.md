Kelly Hodgkins writing for TUAW:

> Google’s Search app for iOS will soon receive an update that’ll improve the voice assistant component and bring it on par with its Android Jelly Bean counterpart. The upcoming version of the search app takes advantage of Google’s experience with speech recognition and its Knowledge Graph, which tries to make connections between different pieces of information.

I’ve been enjoying Google Now on my Nexus 7 and Nexus phone, so having this on the iPhone, where it will rival Siri should be interesting.

I like how I can search for an address for a store on my MacBook or iPad, and then have Google Now tell me distance, etc when I open it.

Siri has been interesting so far, but it has several bugs when in Canada which Google hasn’t been having..
