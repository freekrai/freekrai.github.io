> This summer’s sci-fi action flick Edge of Tomorrow was pretty widely received as a legitimately good summer blockbuster, but for one reason or another it did pretty awful at the box office. Now, as the movie heads on-demand and onto DVD and Blu-ray, Warner Bros. is trying a new strategy to boost sales: it’s basically pretending that the film has a different, cooler name. On iTunes, the film is actually listed as *Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow*, and the DVD cover hides the name at the very bottom in favor of displaying the tagline “Live Die Repeat” in huge letters.

> Edge actually saw a true title change before its release too, being renamed from the edgier but more confusing title *All You Need Is Kill*, which only further goes to show how much of a struggle it’s been to properly market this thing.
