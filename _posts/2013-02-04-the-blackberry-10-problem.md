> BlackBerry needed a stellar launch — both the software and hardware, as well as any new features, had to be blockbuster. They weren’t.
> 
> The company changed its name from RIM to BlackBerry, but so what? Its core business was always the BlackBerry, so the change doesn’t signify any major shift in thinking. When Apple changed its name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. there was a clear shift from just computers to consumer electronic devices, like the iPhone and iPad.
> 
> BlackBerry also announced that Alicia Keys would be the new Global Creative Director. A celebrity endorsement is not what people want, they want a better product.
