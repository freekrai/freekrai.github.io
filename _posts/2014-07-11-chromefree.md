What happens when a long time PC and Chrome power user moves to Mac OS X? How will Safari stack up?

> Coming to OS X after many years as a PC power user, Chrome was the first application on my prearranged hotlist. On Windows, it had long displaced Firefox, which before it, had long displaced Internet Explorer. The only reason I even bothered with Safari when my machine arrived last December, was my curiosity as to how a Mac works out of the box; before I overcrowd it with apps. It wasn’t supposed to be a real chance.

I don’t want to spoil the read, but it turns out that battery consumption is a *huge* part of the story.
