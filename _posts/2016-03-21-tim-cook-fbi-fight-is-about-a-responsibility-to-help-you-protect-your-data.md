> Tim Cook took today's Apple event as a chance to strike back at government demands that the company break security measures on a phone used in the San Bernardino attack. "We built the iPhone for you, our customers," Cook told the crowd. "We need to decide, as a nation, how much power the government should have over our data and our privacy."
> 
> "We did not expect to be in this position, at odds with our own government," he continued, "but we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and your privacy."
