Under “Don’ts”:

> Be creepy or rude (aka, a “*Glasshole*”). Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don’t get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren’t allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you’re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.

If Google actually needs to tell people not to be creepy, then I think there’s a problem here…

You do have to give them credit for embracing “*glasshole*” though.
