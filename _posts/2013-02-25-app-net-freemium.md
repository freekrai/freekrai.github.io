> Although App.net has had only paid account tiers thus far, we initially conceived of App.net as a freemium service. It took some time to get to this point, but we are now ready to make this vision a reality.

I’ve been using App.net more than twitter since signing up. I know that price was holding some people back. So if you don’t mind living with the limitations (“free” users can only follow 40 users and have limits on storage and upload rates), now may be the time.

Only one catch: You have to get an invite from a paid App.net user.
