Anandtech:

> Overall, the iPad Pro has proven to be a very different experience for me than previous iPads. The design is definitely familiar, with the same industrial design and general feel as previous iPads scaled up to a 12.9” form factor.
> 
> On the SoC side, we’re finally seeing a major player in ARM SoCs directly competing with Intel on their home ground of sorts, and the results are at least somewhat shocking. Despite a handicap on process node, the CPU of the A9X isn’t all that far off from Skylake Core M. 
> 
> And while A9X can’t go toe-to-toe, Apple is for the first time capable of reaching Intel’s level for some workloads. Otherwise on the GPU side, Apple arguably bests Intel.

Here is that deeply detailed iPad Pro review you’ve been waiting for.
