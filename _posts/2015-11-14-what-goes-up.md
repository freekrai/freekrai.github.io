Daring Fireball:

> Arguing that Apple is in trouble because the iPhone is so popular is like arguing that the ’90s-era Chicago Bulls were in trouble because Michael Jordan was so good. It’s true Jordan couldn’t play forever — and the iPhone won’t be the most profitable product in the world forever. 
> 
> But in the meantime, the Bulls were well-nigh unbeatable, and Apple, for now at least, is unfathomably profitable.
> 
> Just like how it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, it’s better to have tremendous success for some period of time than never to have had tremendous success in the first place. Right?


Another well written and thought out piece by Gruber, taking down the ridiculousness of the Apple doomsayers. 

There is absoluely zero basis for their prognostications and yet, rather than being spiked by their editors as posts that have no basis in fact or shouted down by the media in general, they are lauded for their “prescience”.
