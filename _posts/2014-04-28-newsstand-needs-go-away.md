Jason Snell:

> What was intended to be a special collection of apps has, instead, become a second-class collection. That’s why it would be better for everyone concerned—Apple, users, [app developers](http://www.marco.org/2013/11/29/ios7-newsstand), and publishers (including *Macworld*)—if Newsstand just vanished.

I have to agree with Jason on this, I’ve worked with Newsstand on a couple projects for clients, and as a developer, you had massive limits.

As an iOS user, it’s got a lot of issues, the biggest ones being: it’s either an empty folder you don’t want, or a needless barrier to accessing your publication apps.
