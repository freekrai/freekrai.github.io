The Roost is a laptop stand that’s inspired by mechanical mechanisms found in scissor lifts and folding chairs. James Olander, the designer, wanted to create something that bring the laptop to your eyes while also helping to alleviate his back and neck problems, while keeping it durable and lightweight.

Made from Carbon Fiber and Delrin (a very strong engineering plastic), The Roost weighs 5 oz and folds into a 1″ by 1.5″ by 13″ package that can easily slip into a backpack or laptop bag. The stand, because of the strong materials used, can also withstand a lot of punishment. In a load test, The Roost was loaded with concrete blocks and slabs, holding 132 lbs of weight without any damage to the product. Olander says that The Roost can be tilted 80 degrees and still hold onto your laptop, making the stand accident proof.

Compatible with most laptops that have a hinge behind the laptop base (a laptop compatibility guide can be found [here](http://www.therooststand.com/pages/compatible-laptops)), [The Roost](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/86285180/the-roost-saving-your-neck-and-back-from-your-lapt) wants to correct your posture and take your laptop to new heights. In addition to black, The Roost will be available in white, titanium, green, red, blue, orange, purple, yellow, and pink if funding is successful. In backing this Kickstarter project for $65, you’ll be rewarded with a black roost engraved with “Original Kickstarter Backer.” If you add another $5, you’ll be able to choose a colored model. The Roost started out with a goal of $9,300 in funding, but has already reached $70,434.
