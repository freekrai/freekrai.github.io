I’ve posted a [turkey cab salad with avacado dressing](http://rogerstringer.com/2005/04/18/turkey-club-salad-with-avacado-dressing) recipe before, but this post is going to expand on the dressing for use as a dip..

This dip is especially nice at BBQs, and this is the season for that.

What you need
-------------

- 2 ripe Hass avocados
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons hot sauce (recommended: Frank’s Red Hot Sauce)

How to make it
--------------

1. Cut all around the ripe avocados down to the pit. Twist and separate the halved fruit. Remove the pit with a spoon, then scoop the flesh with a spoon into your food processor bowl.
2. Add the zest and juice of 1 lemon to the food processor.
3. Chop garlic on your board and mash with 1 teaspoon salt to paste the garlic. Add garlic paste and the red wine vinegar to the food processor.
4. Place lid on the food processor and turn it on. While the blade is spinning, stream in extra-virgin olive oil and add hot sauce.
5. Stop processor, taste dressing and adjust seasonings.
6. Stir, and serve with pita or nacho chips.
