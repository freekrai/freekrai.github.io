> One thing we often recommend in our site analyses, is the use of introductory content on a homepage. We get quite a lot response on that, with people being unclear how to do that. “Where should I put that content?” or “How long should that content be?” or the one I dislike the most: “I don’t need that”.

Interesting article about making sure your website has good introductory content…

In some projects, I’ve actually done the introductory content of a site before anything else.. It helps focus on what the rest of the site is all about.
