> Android users have been playing Google’s augmented reality game Ingress for quite some time, and today iOS gamers can finally find out what the fuss is all about. The new iPhone and iPad version of the game will work cross-platform so that you can play with the existing community on Android. Ingress puts players into one of two different factions, as they engage in a sci-fi struggle for humanity while exploring real-world locations using their phone’s geolocation data.

I’ve been playing Ingress on android devices since it was in beta back in 2012, and now I can finally play it on my iPhone, which is the preferred way to play.

Google announced a year ago that this would be happening, and it’s nice to finally have it come.
