MG Siegler:

> With the news today about the Chromebook Pixel, the pieces are all starting to come together. Google says it’s selling that product through the Google Play online store and through Best Buy’s and Currys PC World’s websites. (And they’ll be available to use, but not buy, inside some Best Buys and Currys.) That won’t be good enough.
> 
> Google has been attempting to sell various Nexus products through their online stores for years now. The results have ranged from some success (Nexus 4) to fail (Nexus One) to major fail (Nexus Q). The Best Buy results seem mixed as well. While Chromebooks are finally seeing some traction, it’s still minimal despite the reach of Best Buy.
> 
> What Google *needs* for these products is what Apple needed a decade ago: their own stores that they’re in complete control of to showcase their products.

The one item from Google that **really** demands a retail presence is Google Glass.

But here’s the bottom line: *a physical presence makes a lot of sense when you’re trying to sell physical products.*
