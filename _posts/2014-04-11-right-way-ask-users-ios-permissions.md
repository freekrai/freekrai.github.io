Asking a user for permission to send them push notifications or to access their private data can be a little bit of a minefield.

> For many apps, not getting access to a phone’s sensors or data can change the entire user experience. For example, if an app depends on where the user is standing, declining access to location could render the app useless. More subtly, if push notifications play a critical role in getting your user to form a habit of using your app, declined access could lead to you losing them forever.

> Making it all worse is that when a user taps “Don’t Allow”, there is no easy way for them to reverse that decision.
