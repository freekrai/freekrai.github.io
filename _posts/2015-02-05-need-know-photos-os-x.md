![What you need to know about Photos for OS X](http://cdn.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photos-mac-info-screen.jpg "What you need to know about Photos for OS X")

Great info from Serenity Caldwell on the new Photos Mac beta.

I’m actually looking forward to this app, it sounds like a very good fit for my usage, always wanting more pro editing tools than iPhoto but simpler library management than Aperture and better iOS integration than Lightroom.

Most of my photo editing these days is done on pixelmator, which works great, but I’m looking forward to trying out Photos when it comes out.
