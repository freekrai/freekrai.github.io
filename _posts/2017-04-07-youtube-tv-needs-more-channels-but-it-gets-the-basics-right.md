> YouTube TV [launched earlier this week](https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/05/youtube-tv-now-available/), bringing another option to the quickly growing online TV subscription space. It's basically the cord-cutting dream; being able to watch shows, news or sports as they happen instead of waiting for your favorite sitcom to show up on Hulu the next day. 
> 
> Of course, YouTube TV and its competitors (which include [Sony's PlayStation Vue](https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/06/ps-vue-multiview-mode/), [Sling TV](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/24/sling-tv-extra-channel-bundles/) and [DirecTV Now](https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/30/directv-now-hands-on/)) all have their flaws. There isn't a perfect option out there yet, but after spending the better part of the week watching YouTube TV I can say it definitely has some things going for it over the competition -- but it's also pretty clearly a service in its infancy.
