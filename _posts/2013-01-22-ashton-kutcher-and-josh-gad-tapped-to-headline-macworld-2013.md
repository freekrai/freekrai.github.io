Chris Welch, writing for The Verge:

> Ever since Apple bailed on the Macworld conference in 2009, organizers have had to come up with inventive ways to maintain interest in the annual expo. This year, that involved recruiting actors Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad, both of whom star in the forthcoming Steve Jobs biopic jOBS. On January 31st, Kutcher and Gad will take to the main stage at Macworld — again co-branded as “iWorld” this year to account for the wild popularity of iOS — and share what it was like portraying Apple’s legendary duo of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on the big screen.

The headliners each year at MacWorld are.. interesting picks..

My favourite is still Sinbad in 2011, partly because one of the apps he said were his favourite is an app I worked on..
