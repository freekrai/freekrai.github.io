Paul Thurrott:

> I really like Windows 8 and think Windows RT is a great long-term play against the iPad and other tablet challengers.
> 
> But any excitement Microsoft generated around this launch will be squandered when people realize they just bought something that looks like Windows 8 but comes with even fewer apps than Windows Phone.
