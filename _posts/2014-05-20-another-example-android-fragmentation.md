Game Oven, announcing the postponement of the Android version of a new game:

> <iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="https://vine.co/v/MgWLMmmwUQQ/embed/simple?audio=1" width="600"></iframe><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script>
> 
> In the Vine above are 7 devices all running the same compass app (ironically named Steady Compass) on Android. Yet, all compasses indicate that North is somewhere else. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with electromagnetic fields confusing the compass; it has everything to do with the diversity of hardware inside these devices.
> 
> We have been developing Bounden for Android alongside its development on iOS, and have tested the game on a number of devices. It was only a week ago that we started expanding our list of test devices, after we quickly discovered that:
> 
> (a) some devices had ‘broken’ gyroscopes that didn’t work on all axis,  
>  (b) that some devices were faking gyroscopes by mixing and matching the accelerometer data with compass data, or  
>  (c) that some devices did not have a gyroscope at all.

And people say there is no fragmentation in Android?
