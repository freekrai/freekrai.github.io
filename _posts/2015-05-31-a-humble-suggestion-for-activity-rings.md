David Smith:

> I love the Apple Watch activity rings. I really do. Whoever at Apple came up with the idea of showing your activity as three concentric circles that you close when you complete your goal deserves a raise. It taps into the completionist part of my brain a way few other things do. It *bothers* me to leave one un-closed, which is exactly what it should do.

> The trouble I have is the visual difference between the last three’s exercise ring. I find it very difficult to tell the difference between an *almost* filled exercise ring and an *actually* filled exercise ring. This has caused me to miss a few days unintentionally when I thought I had reached my goal, only to discover later that I’d slightly missed it. I hit this on the 42mm watch, looking at my wife’s 38mm the problem is even more significant.
