Ben Thompson:

Thompson is overthinking it with the “two models” thing. I think there’ll be just one model, $99 (or even less). The only upsell for gaming would be optional controllers (including any of the [third-party controllers iOS already supports](http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-arcade-ios-game-controllers-compared/)).
