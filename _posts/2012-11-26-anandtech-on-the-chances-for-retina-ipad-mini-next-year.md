I can say without a doubt that the Mini will get retina, and once it does.. It will be exactly like all previous iOS devices: same physical size, double the pixel resolution.

The only question is when?

The iPhone went retina in the fourth generation; the full-size iPad in the third. Heck, the iPod Touch didn’t go retina until the 5th generaton.

It does seem like a little too much to ask for the Mini to do so in its second.
