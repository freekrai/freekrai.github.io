M.G. Siegler:

> I suspect this new MacBook will be the last laptop I end up buying. Again, that doesn’t mean the MacBook is dying anytime soon, but I believe this will be the pinnacle of the product. We’ll get spec bumps for years to come. But it will be the long, slow fade we just witnessed with the iPod.

I use my MacBook for my dev work, but I can do a lot of my work on my iPad now thanks to the use of apps, so I can see where Siegler is going with this.
