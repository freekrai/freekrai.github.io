Craig Hockenberry, on thinking about Apple and wearable devices:

> Given everything presented above, it’s pretty clear to me that a “smartwatch” isn’t in Apple’s immediate future. But they’re clearly interested in wearable technology. So what are the alternatives for a product that could be released this year?
> 
> The first step is to start looking at things from Apple’s point-of-view. I ask myself, “What problems can a wearable device solve?”
> 
> As I think about answers to that question, it leads me to the conclusion that Jony Ive and crew aren’t looking solely at the wrist. Wearable technology could take cues from other kinds of jewelry: rings and necklaces, for example.
