A supercut of all the things James Oâ€™Malley did when he visited Canada.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/--2qgENccqs?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" type="text/html" width="640"></iframe></span>

There are a few more things to do up here than what he posted, but that really depends on where you are. My family and I live in Penticton, where you can golf and ski in the same day and are on the edge of the [Okanagan Desert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okanagan_Desert).
