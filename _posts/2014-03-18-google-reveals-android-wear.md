Dante D’Orazio, writing for The Verge:

> Google is officially getting into wearables. The company has announced Android Wear, a version of the operating system designed specifically for wearable devices. To start with, the system is made for smartwatches, and Google is moving aggressively to make itself the key name in wearables.
> 
> The company has released two videos that show off what the watch interface will look like, and from what we’ve seen, it’s very impressive. In addition, [Motorola and LG have already revealed their first Android Wear smartwatches](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/18/5522340/motorola-lg-announce-upcoming-android-wear-smartwatches), which look more attractive than any smartwatches we’ve seen to date. Motorola’s first device is featured in the picture above and the videos below.
> 
> There are several key features that have been announced. Of course, fitness is a key component. Google says that you’ll be able to get “real-time speed, distance and time information on your wrist for your run, cycle or walk.” Naturally, that means Google Maps will be built in so that you’ll be able to get directions directly from your wrist.
> 
> The company will also be using Google Now in the watches. Automatic, passive reminders will be sent to users via their smartwatch. The watches will also connect with Android smartphones so that you’ll be able to get all the notifications that you want from whatever apps you have installed on your phone.

Android Wear looks interesting.. Mostly looks like a watch version of Google Now.. I do find it interesting that Samsung is on board with this and is willing to throw out their Gear smartwatch.. Or maybe the Gear will continue as one product and they’ll make a Wear version seperately?
