> “Never give up,” was the advice Pebble CEO and founder, Eric Migicovsky, gave to aspiring entrepreneurs at the JOLT Uncensored event at the MaRS Discovery District Centre last Thursday — advice he had followed for his own company.
> 
>  For most people, the first time they had heard of Pebble was likely its success on Kickstarter back in 2012. But Migicovsky’s smartwatch journey actually started four years before, in the BlackBerry-centric town of Waterloo.
> 
>  Born in Vancouver, Migicovsky moved to Southern Ontario to study systems engineering at the University of Waterloo. One year before he graduated he formed his first company, Allerta, to create inPulse, a watch that provided BlackBerry notifications on a user’s wrist. Allerta was one of the first companies in the VeloCity program at UofW.
