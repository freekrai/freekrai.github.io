Over at Daring Fireball, John Gruber has rounded up some of the Surface Pro reviews and adds some commentary to go along with it.

While Mac Rumors also posted a fewÂ [links to reviews](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/05/first-reviews-of-microsoft-surface-pro-good-display-full-windows-8-compromised-experience/).

Most reviews say the same thing.. Stay away from the Surface Pro.
