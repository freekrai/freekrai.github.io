Justin Williams, a [long-time iOS developer](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/), went to [Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) last week:

> Build allowed me three days to immerse myself in technologies that I know almost nothing about. I came away impressed with it too. For all its past faults, the *New Microsoft* is doing things that are on the cutting edge of technology.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Cloud sync has become such an integral factor in our multi-device lives, </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">and Microsoft Azure is growing into a pretty decent cloud platform to build on </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> for those of us who need something more robust than iCloud but who can’t or don’t want to roll their own server.</span>

And there are so many options these days too, Simperium, Parse, Firebase, Dropbox datastore, and Microsoft Azure.
