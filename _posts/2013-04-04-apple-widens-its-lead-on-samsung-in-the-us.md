Jim Dalrymple:

> From comScore market research firm:
> 
> > 133.7 million people in the U.S. owned smartphones (57 percent mobile market penetration) during the three months ending in February, up 8 percent since November. Apple ranked as the top OEM  
> >  with 38.9 percent of U.S. smartphone subscribers (up 3.9 percentage points from November). Samsung ranked second with 21.3 percent market share (up 1 percentage point), followed by HTC with 9.3 percent share, Motorola with 8.4 percent and LG with 6.8 percent.
> 
> And Apple is making ground on Google:
> 
> > Google Android ranked as the top smartphone platform with 51.7 percent market share, while Apple’s share increased 3.9 percentage points to 38.9 percent. BlackBerry ranked third with 5.4 percent share, followed by Microsoft (3.2 percent) and Symbian (0.5 percent).
> 
> So, let me get this straight. Apple is widening the gap on Samsung, but analysts think Apple should be more like Samsung. Not only that, it’s closing the gap between iOS and Android, even though it’s competing with hundreds of Android devices.
> 
> And Apple is losing how?

Jim nails it here.. Right now, it’s more politics than anything else on the perception of who is leading who..

I’m sure tomorrow the Wall Street Journal will spin this report to show that Apple is in fact behind Samsung…
