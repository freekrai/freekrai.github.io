I’m Roger Stringer, and I’m a DevOps Engineer, full-stack software developer, [writer](/writing), and speaker in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada.

This blog is where I write and share. You will see everything from reviews, posts about tech and design, to [food](/tags/food).

I’m the founder of [Flybase](https://flybase.io/ "Flybase"), a real-time app platform that enables developers to quickly build apps without having to worry about the backend stuff. You can find me blogging at the [Flybase Blog](https://blog.flybase.io) on various topics, and also at the [Coded Geekery](https://codedgeekery.com) blog, which is a more long form blog .

I also work heavily with [Twilio](http://twiliocookbook.com), PHP, Node.js / JavaScript, NoSQL, APIs, [DevOps](http://devops.freekrai.net), Angular.js, and WordPress, so you’ll see some posts about all of these on here, as well as a variety of other topics.

I’m also a dad, music lover, film buff, comic book collector, [foodie](/tags/food) and electric scooter enthusiast _(specifically the Ecoped Pulse)_. I spend my spare time building things, doing fun stuff with my daughter, and cooking up new recipes to post on here.

I’m also a type-2 insulin dependant diabetic, so once in a while, you’ll see some posts related to that as well.
